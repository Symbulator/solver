# symbulator — Symbulator 9

**Symbulator 9** is a port of Symbulator 8 — Roberto Perez-Franco's symbolic
linear-circuit simulator for the TI-Nspire CAS — to Python and SymPy, with
minor improvements. This package is its solver core.

All of the original's analysis tools are now ported: DC, AC (phasor),
s-domain (Laplace), and transient analysis; Thevenin/Norton equivalents;
two-port parameter extraction; and the expert-mode dispatcher. See
**Scope** below for the handful of things that are intentionally
simplified relative to the calculator version, and why.

*AI coding agent?* This README is written to be read start to finish and
followed directly — the Quick start and Circuit description syntax
sections below have everything needed to write a correct circuit
description on the first try. See also [llms.txt](https://github.com/Symbulator/solver/blob/main/llms.txt) for a short
index and the three details that are easiest to get wrong.

## Install

```
pip install symbulator
```

Python 3.9 or later; the only dependency is SymPy. Two extras:
`pip install "symbulator[plot]"` adds NumPy for `time_samples()` and
`bode_samples()`, and `pip install "symbulator[notebook]"` adds JupyterLab,
NumPy and Matplotlib for the notebooks.

From a checkout of the repository: `pip install -e .` (or
`pip install -e ".[test]"` to run the tests).

## Quick start

```python
from symbulator import dc, ac, fd, tr, th, er, port

# 5V source through a 1k/1k voltage divider
res = dc("e1,1,0,5:r1,1,2,1'k:r2,2,0,1'k")
print(res.v("2"))     # 5/2
print(res.i("r1"))    # 1/400 (2.5 mA)
print(res["p_r1"])    # power dissipated in r1

# Series RLC driven at omega = 1000 rad/s
res = ac("e1,1,0,10:r1,1,2,100:l1,2,3,0.1:c1,3,0,1e-6", omega=1000)
print(res.v("2"))
print(res["z_e1"])    # input impedance seen by the source

# Thevenin equivalent between node 2 and ground
eq = th("e1,1,0,12:r1,1,2,4'k:r2,2,0,2'k", "2", "0", domain="dc")
print(eq.vth, eq.z, eq.pmax)

# Step response of an RC circuit, in the time domain
res = tr("e1,1,0,5:r1,1,2,1000:c1,2,0,1'u", variables=["v_2"])
print(res["v_2"])      # 5 - 5*exp(-1000*t)
```

## Circuit description syntax

Unchanged from the calculator (minus the leading `:`): elements are
separated by `:`, fields within an element by `,`. Node `0` is ground.

| Prefix | Element | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `r` | resistor | name,n1,n2,value |
| `l` | inductor | name,n1,n2,value[,initial_current] |
| `c` | capacitor | name,n1,n2,value[,initial_voltage] |
| `e` | voltage source (indep. or dependent) | name,n1,n2,value |
| `j` | current source (indep. or dependent) | name,n1,n2,value |
| `o` | ideal op-amp (nullor) | name,n_plus,n_minus,n_out |
| `m` | mutual inductance | name,Lname1,Lname2,M — or `k=0.5` for M as a coupling factor |
| `s` | short circuit | name,n1,n2 |
| `t` | ideal transformer | name,n1,n2,turns1,turns2 · name,n1,n2,[turns1,turns2] · name,[tl,bl],[tr,br],[turns1,turns2] |
| `z,y,h,g,a,b` | two-port block | name,n1,n2 · name,[tl,bl],[tr,br] — either followed by an optional [p11,p12,p21,p22] |

The optional initial-condition field on `l`/`c` (initial inductor
current / capacitor voltage) is only meaningful for `fd()`/`tr()`; it's
ignored by `dc()`/`ac()`. Unlike the original -- which required a
different field count per element depending on which analysis tool was
running -- this port always accepts the extra field and just treats it
as 0 if omitted, regardless of which function you call.

**Dependent (controlled) sources** work "for free": a value field can be
any SymPy-parseable expression referencing other node-voltage/current
symbols (`v_<node>`, `i_<element>`), e.g. `e2,3,0,2*v_2` for a VCVS.
This mirrors how the original evaluated value strings through the
calculator's own expression engine.

**Case matters for variables, but not for names.** Element and node
names fold to lowercase (`R1` and `r1` are one resistor, node `A` is
node `a`), and so does any reference *derived from them*: `2*VR1`,
`2*vr1` and `2*v_r1` all mean r1's voltage drop, the same spelling
equivalence that makes `ir1` ≡ `i_r1` ≡ `IR1`. A variable that names
nothing in the circuit is an ordinary SymPy symbol and IS
case-sensitive: `e,a,b,c` and `e,a,b,C` are two different sources, and
a condition `c = 5` does not touch `C`. The boundary is exact: a name
folds when (and only when) its folded spelling matches an answer of
the circuit -- a `v_...`/`i_...`/`p_...` of some element or node.

**Unit shorthand:** the calculator's own `'k`/`'M`/`'u`/... syntax
(`1'k` = 1000) is always unambiguous, as is an explicit product with a
symbol (`1*k`). A *bare* suffix like `1k` could mean either one, so by
default (`suffix="ask"`) it raises `AmbiguousValueError` listing every
such value; pass `suffix="si"` to read them all as SI units, or
`suffix="var"` to read them all as number-times-variable. Use
`find_ambiguous_values(desc)` to scan a description without solving --
that's what the web front end uses to ask the user interactively.

**Two-port parameters** (`z/y/h/g/a/b`) ride in the description as an
optional last term, a four-entry list:

```python
res = dc("e1,1,0,10:y1,1,2,[0.001,-0.001,-0.001,0.001]:rl,2,0,1'k")
```

Entries may be numbers, SI-prefixed values or expressions (symbols
included); each binds the correspondingly-named variable (`y11`,
`y12`, ... for an element named `y`; `y111`, ... for one named `y1` --
the element's name prefixes the digits) through the same substitution
machinery as `conditions=`, so an explicit condition on the same name
still overrides the description. Without the term, the parameters are
free symbols of those names -- the tacit term `[y111,y112,y121,y122]`
-- matching the original's "leave them symbolic" default, and they can
be pinned via `conditions=` or the older `params` dict, which is still
accepted:

```python
params = {"y1": {"11": "0.001", "12": "-0.001", "21": "-0.001", "22": "0.001"}}
res = dc("e1,1,0,10:y1,1,2:rl,2,0,1'k", params=params)
```

**All four terminals** (since 0.5.27). A transformer or two-port block
has two ports of two terminals each. The forms above name the top
terminal of each port and ground the other two, as the calculator did.
Write a node term as a bracketed pair, `[top,bottom]`, and all four are
named:

```python
# an ideal transformer between two live pairs; here r5 grounds the
# secondary's side -- without it, that side would be given a local
# reference of its own (see "A side of the circuit with no path to node 0")
res = dc("e,1,0,10:r0,1,2,1:t,[2,4],[3,5],[2,1]:r4,4,0,3:rl,3,5,100:r5,5,0,7")

# an h-parameter stage with a resistor under its common terminal
res = dc("e,1,0,0.01:rs,1,2,1000:h,[2,3],[4,3],[1000,2.5e-4,100,25e-6]:re,3,0,100:rc,4,0,2000")

# the autotransformer as one tapped winding: the second winding's
# bottom is the first winding's top
res = ac("e,1,0,120:t,[1,0],[2,1],[80,120]:rl,2,0,8+6j", omega=1000)
```

Rules: a transformer's turns must be a pair `[N1,N2]` when its nodes are
pairs (`t,n1,n2,[N1,N2]` is also accepted on the two-node form); either
node of a pair may be `0`, so `z,[1,0],[2,0]` is `z,1,2` written out; a
port with the same node at both terminals is refused; and the two ports
never conduct across each other, so a side of the circuit reached only
through a port has no path to node 0 of its own. It is given a local
reference rather than refused (see *A side of the circuit with no path to
node 0* below); a dangling piece of ordinary elements is still refused as
floating (code 217).

**The currents.** A transformer or two-port reports the current
*entering* it at each of its live terminals, `i_<name><node>` -- `i_t1`,
`i_t2` for `t,1,2,80,200`; four of them for a paired form; one sum
where a node is named at two terminals (a common bottom). Version 8
reported both of a transformer's currents and the port had lost the
secondary until 0.5.27.

Use `port()` (below) to go the other way and *extract* z/y/h/g/a/b
parameters from an actual sub-circuit.

## DC / AC / s-domain results

`dc()`, `ac()`, and `fd()` return a `Result` with:
- `res.v(node)` -- node voltage
- `res.i(name)` -- element/branch current
- `res["p_<name>"]` -- power in watts: in DC the power consumed, in AC the
  average (real) power, the real part of the complex power under either
  convention (`res["ap_<name>"]` is the same answer under the calculator's
  name); **not apparent power** -- that is `abs(res["s_<name>"])`
- `res["q_<name>"]` -- reactive power in vars (AC only), the imaginary part
- `res["s_<name>"]` -- complex power (AC only)
- `res["z_<name>"]` / `res["r_<name>"]` -- impedance / resistance seen by a source (AC / DC only)

(The power/impedance derived quantities are DC/AC-only, matching the
original -- `fd()` doesn't compute them either.)

`ac()` takes a `use_rms=True` flag to switch the power convention from
peak-amplitude phasors (default, dividing by 2) to RMS phasors, matching
the original's `userms` setting.

## Thevenin / Norton: `th()` and `er()`

```python
eq = th("e1,1,0,12:r1,1,2,4'k:r2,2,0,2'k", n1="2", n2="0", domain="dc")
eq.vth    # open-circuit (Thevenin) voltage
eq.ino    # short-circuit (Norton) current
eq.z      # Req (dc) or Zeq (ac) = vth/ino
eq.pmax   # max power transferable to a matched load
```

`th()` is for **active** circuits (ones with their own independent
sources) -- it raises if the open-circuit voltage comes out to 0, same
as the original's redirect message. For a **passive** (source-free)
network, use `er()` instead, which injects a single 1A test current and
reads the equivalent resistance/impedance directly:

```python
req = er("r1,1,2,1'k:r2,2,0,2'k", n1="1", n2="0", domain="dc")  # 3000
```

## Two-port extraction: `port()`

Extracts z/y/h/g/a/b parameters of a whole circuit between two grounded
ports (the inverse of feeding pre-defined parameters into a `z`/`y`/...
circuit *element*, described above):

```python
params = port("r1,1,3,100:r2,2,3,200:r3,3,0,50", n1="1", n2="2", kind="z", domain="dc")
params["11"], params["12"], params["21"], params["22"]
```

Works the same way in AC (pass `omega=...` and `domain="ac"`) and in the
s-domain (`domain="fd"`).

**A port that floats** is written as a `[top,bottom]` pair instead of a
node, the same spelling a four-terminal two-port *element* uses. A ladder
with resistors in both rails, Alexander & Sadiku's Problem 19.2, has no
grounded port and no node 0 at all:

```python
z = port("r1,a,b,1:r2,b,c,1:r3,c,d,1:r4,d,e,1:r5,f,g,1:r6,g,h,1:r7,h,i,1:"
         "r8,i,j,1:r9,b,g,1:r10,c,h,1:r11,d,i,1", "[a,f]", "[e,j]", "z")
z["11"], z["12"]          # 41/15, 1/15
```

Grounding both bottoms instead would short out the lower rail and give a
different circuit's answer (11/5 and 3/5). The tool takes each port's lower
terminal as the reference for its own measurement, which is what the
definition of the parameters does.

**A side of the circuit with no path to node 0** -- the far side of a
transformer or a parameter block that nothing grounds -- is not an error:
it is given a reference of its own, the first port bottom in it, whose
voltage is reported as 0, and the result says so:

```python
res = dc("za,[p,0],[q,m],[25,20,5,10]:zb,[p,0],[m,n],[50,25,25,30]:e1,p,0,1")
res.references        # {'m': ['q', 'n']}
res.notes[0]["text"]  # "Node(s) m, q, n have no path to node 0 (they lie behind
                      #  a port), so their voltages are measured against m, taken as 0."
```

Every current and every voltage *difference* is the same whichever node
of the island is held at 0; only the island's absolute potentials depend on
it. A dangling piece of ordinary elements (`r1,2,3,1` on its own) is still
refused as floating.

## s-domain and transient: `fd()` and `tr()`

**The two read their sources in different domains, and that is the whole
point of having both.** `tr()` reads a source value as a function of time;
`fd()` reads it as an expression in `s`. A value of `5` is a 5 V step to
`tr()` and a 5 V impulse to `fd()` -- different circuits, not different
notations for the same one.

```python
from symbulator import fd, tr, t2s, s2t

# Step response of an RC low-pass, starting from rest.
res_t = tr("e1,1,0,5:r1,1,2,1000:c1,2,0,1e-6")      # source in time
res_s = fd("e1,1,0,5/s:r1,1,2,1000:c1,2,0,1e-6")    # the same source, in s
res_t["v_2"]        # 5 - 5*exp(-1000*t)
res_s["v_2"]        # 5000/(s*(s + 1000))

# Natural response of a discharging inductor with an initial condition
res_t = tr("l1,0,2,0.2,3:r1,2,0,100", variables=["i_l1"])  # I0=3A, L=0.2H, R=100 ohm
res_t["i_l1"]   # 3*exp(-500*t)
```

`tr()` transforms each source for you, by what the value is:

| Source value | Read as |
|---|---|
| a function of `t` -- `u(t)`, `t`, `2*exp(-4*t)` | transformed with `t2s()` |
| a constant -- `12`, `vs` | a step of that amplitude (`value/s`) |
| already written in `s` -- `5/s` | left alone |
| a reference to another answer -- `2*i_r1` | left alone; a controlled source is a relation, not a waveform |

In `fd()` nothing is transformed, because `fd()` is the s-domain. To give
it a value written in time, wrap it in braces -- `{5}`, `{u(t)}`,
`{2*exp(-4*t)}` -- which is the calculator's shorthand for `t2s(...)` and
works only there.

`t2s()`/`s2t()` wrap SymPy's `laplace_transform`/`inverse_laplace_transform`
directly, for preparing a source value by hand or checking an answer. Both
are usable inside a circuit description, an `equations=` entry, or any
expression you hand back to the package.

`tr(desc, variables=[...])` lets you limit which answers get
inverse-Laplace-transformed -- useful since that step can be slow (or
fail to find a closed form) for complicated expressions; omit
`variables` to attempt every solved node voltage and element current.
Any individual variable that can't be transformed is silently left out
of the result rather than failing the whole call.

**History, in case you meet an older version:** releases before 0.5.5
skipped the forward transform. The original called out to a separate
`lf\\laplace` calculator library that was not in the document this was
ported from, so `tr()` inverse-transformed its answers but passed its
sources through untouched -- which made every transient result one
integration short, an impulse response where a step response was meant.
SymPy's own `laplace_transform` does the job, and 0.5.5 restored the
behaviour the calculator versions have always had. A description written
for Symbulator 7 or 8 now gives the same answer here.

## Working with the answers (SymPy)

Every answer is a SymPy expression — exact where the inputs were exact
(the quick start's `res.v("2")` really is the rational `5/2`, not the
float `2.5`) — so everything SymPy does applies to it directly:
`float()`, `simplify()`, `.subs()`, `limit()`, `plot()`, `lambdify()`.

```python
import sympy as sp
from symbulator import dc

res = dc("e1,1,0,vin:r1,1,2,ra:r2,2,0,rb")
sp.simplify(res.v("2"))          # rb*vin/(ra + rb)
```

**The one trap: the time symbol carries an assumption.** Time-domain
answers are written in `Symbol("t", nonnegative=True)`. To SymPy, a
bare `Symbol("t")` is a *different* symbol — same name, different
assumptions — so substituting with one does nothing, and does it
silently:

```python
from symbulator import tr, fd, t, s   # <- the package's own t and s

res = tr("e1,1,0,5:r1,1,2,1000:c1,2,0,1e-6")
res["v_2"]                            # 5.0 - 5.0*exp(-1000.0*t)

res["v_2"].subs(sp.Symbol("t"), 0.001)   # unchanged — silently a no-op
res["v_2"].subs(t, 0.001)                # 3.16060...
res.at("v_2", t=0.001)                   # 3.16060... — same, by name
```

Two escapes, either fine: `res.at(...)` substitutes **by name**, so it
can never miss (`res.at(t=0.001)` with no key returns a whole new
`Result` evaluated at that instant); or import the package's own `t`
and `s` symbols and use them wherever an expression leaves the package.
Everything below uses the imported symbols.

**Initial and final values** are a substitution and a limit:

```python
res["v_2"].subs(t, 0)                # 0 — starts from rest
sp.limit(res["v_2"], t, sp.oo)       # 5 — settles at the source voltage

# Same check on the s-domain answer, by the final-value theorem:
resf = fd("e1,1,0,5/s:r1,1,2,1000:c1,2,0,1e-6")
sp.limit(s * resf["v_2"], s, 0)      # 5
```

**Plotting a transient** works with SymPy's own `plot` — with the
imported `t`, not a fresh `Symbol("t")`, or the curve comes out
constant:

```python
sp.plot(res["v_2"], (t, 0, 0.005))
```

For anything beyond a quick look, `lambdify` turns an answer into a
plain numeric function for NumPy/Matplotlib:

```python
import numpy as np
f = sp.lambdify(t, res["v_2"], "numpy")
f(np.linspace(0, 0.005, 400))        # ready to plot, fit, export...
```

**Frequency response needs `bode_samples()`, not `plot()`.** An `ac()`
result is a phasor at one fixed `omega` — there is nothing in it to
sweep — so the package samples the frequency axis for you, returning
`(freq_hz, mag_db, phase_deg)` ready for any plotting library:

```python
from symbulator import bode_samples, time_samples

freq, mag_db, phase = bode_samples(
    "e1,1,0,1:r1,1,2,1000:c1,2,0,1e-6", "v_2", 10, 100_000)
```

Its twin `time_samples(desc, key, t_max)` samples a transient
numerically — useful when the inverse Laplace transform of a
complicated answer has no closed form and `tr()` leaves that variable
out: the sampler sidesteps the symbolic inversion entirely.

**`pf()` has the calculator's two forms, and they read different
powers.** Give it a complex value — a complex power such as `res["s_e"]`,
an impedance, a number, an expression with symbols in it — and it returns
|Re| / |S|, symbolic if the value is, and no direction (the app prints the
word for a numerical value, read on the value as given, beside the same
number). Give it an
element's *name* with the `Result` of the AC solve and it returns the
sentence version 8 printed, with the word:

```python
from symbulator import ac, pf

res = ac("e,1,0,30:r1,1,2,6:r2,2,0,-2j:r3,2,0,4",
         omega=sp.Symbol("omega"), use_rms=True)
pf(res["s_e"])          # 0.973417...  — the value alone
pf("e", res)            # 'pf: 0.97342 leading'
pf("r2", res)           # 'pf: 0.0 leading'
pf(sp.Symbol("x") + 2*sp.I)   # Abs(x)/sqrt(x**2 + 4)
```

Which power the reading is taken on is the whole subtlety, and it is the
calculator's rule. A *variable* such as `s_e`, `s_j` or `s_r1` is read as
it stands — the complex power *consumed*, which is what the package stores
for every element, source or load alike. That cannot tell leading from
lagging (the same power is consumed by one side of a branch and delivered
by the other), so this form gives the value alone. A *name* is read by the
element's kind: a load (`r`, `l`, `c`) on the power it *consumes*, so an
inductive load reads lagging; a source (`e`, `j`) on the power it
*delivers*, the current negated first, so a source reads the circuit it
sees, and a source feeding an inductive load says lagging like the load.
The value is the same either way; only the word depends on it, and a
source read on `s_e` would say the opposite word. The name form needs the
element's voltage and current to evaluate to numbers; with a symbol still
in them it raises, and the value form still works.

## In a notebook (Jupyter, JupyterLab, Colab, VS Code)

The package works in a notebook as it is -- every answer is a SymPy
expression, so it typesets on its own -- and a few things are there to
make it feel at home. To set up a local notebook in one line:

```
pip install symbulator[notebook]
```

The extra brings JupyterLab, NumPy and Matplotlib; the package itself
needs only SymPy, so on Google Colab a plain `pip install symbulator`
in the first cell is enough.

**Results display as mathematics.** A bare `res` at the end of a cell
shows every answer typeset, one aligned row each, with the analysis
named above them; a Thevenin result shows its four values the same way
and a `port()` result shows its 2×2 matrix. At a terminal the plain
text form is unchanged. Long floats are the numbers as solved; for the
app's *Rounding* setting use `res.rounded(4)` (exact integers stay as
they are), and keep the unrounded result for arithmetic.

```python
from symbulator import dc, ac, th, draw

res = dc("e1,1,0,5:r1,1,2,1'k:r2,2,0,1'k")
res                      # the whole result, typeset
res["v2"]                # one answer -- typeset too, since it is SymPy
draw("e1,1,0,5:r1,1,2,1'k:r2,2,0,1'k")     # the schematic, inline
```

**The tutorial's spellings work.** The book at learn.symbulator.com
writes `ir1` and `v2`; the package has always stored `i_r1` and
`v_2`. A `Result` now answers to either, so `res["ir1"]`,
`res["v2"]` and `"pr1" in res` all do what a reader of the tutorial
expects. Stored names are still the underscored ones (`list(res)`,
`res.values`), and inside an *expression* -- an expert-mode equation
or condition -- use the underscored form, `equations=["v_2 = 6"]`.

**Phasors as magnitude and angle.** `polar()` is the app's `aa`
mini-tool: `polar(res["v2"])` gives `9.939∠-6.34°`, rounded to four
significant figures (pass `digits=None` for all of them), with
`.magnitude` and `.angle` as the two numbers and `complex()` giving
the value back.

**A cell can be a circuit.** After `%load_ext symbulator`, a cell
that starts with `%%dc` (or `%%ac`, `%%fd`, `%%tr`) takes the circuit
one element per line, the way the app's Input File card does, draws
it and shows the answers:

```
%%ac omega=1000 into=res
e1,1,0,10
r1,1,2,100
l1,2,3,0.1
c1,3,0,1e-6
```

Options go on the magic's line -- `omega=1000`, `rms`,
`variables=v_2,i_r1`, `into=res` to bind the result to a name,
`nodraw` to skip the drawing -- and are passed to the analysis
function. Multi-line descriptions are accepted everywhere, so a circuit
copied from the tutorial pastes straight in.

**The app's two cards, once a circuit is solved.** On the calculator the
answers sat in the machine's variables and the next line could use them;
the app gives that back as the Evaluate box and the Solve card, and
`evaluate()` and `solve()` are the same two for a notebook. Both take
the result of any analysis and return SymPy.

```python
from symbulator import dc, ac, fd, th, evaluate, solve

res = dc("e1,1,0,vs:r1,1,2,1'k:r2,2,0,1'k")
evaluate(res, "v2/vs")                       # 1/2
evaluate(res, "v2", conditions=["vs = 10"])  # 5 -- the calculator's `|`
solve(res, ["v2 = 6"], ["vs"])               # [{'vs': 12}]
```

Names match however they are spelled (`i_r1`, `ir1`, `IR1`), and
everything a circuit value may use works here too (`2'k`, `^`, `u(t)`,
`{...}` in FD). `evaluate()` also answers `pf(e)`, `s2t(vo)` and
`limit(s*vo, s, 0)` -- each with the answers substituted in before the
function is applied, which is the whole difficulty -- takes a condition
at infinity as a limit (`conditions=["s = oo"]`, the initial-value
theorem), and on a `th()` result knows the load answers `irl`, `vrl` and
`prl` in the variable `load`:

```python
eq = th("e1,1,0,12:r1,1,2,4'k:r2,2,0,2'k", "2", "0")
evaluate(eq, "prl", conditions=["load = 1000"])
```

`solve()` substitutes the answers first, so an equation may name `v2` or
`ir1` directly, and solves for whatever is left; a condition that pins a
symbol is applied before solving, a comparison filters the roots after,
and `real_only=True` is the calculator's `solve()` against its `cSolve()`:

```python
# the resonant frequency: where the source sees no reactance
res = ac("e,1,0,20:r,1,2,2:l,2,3,1'm:c,3,0,.4'u", "w")
solve(res, ["im(ze) = 0"], ["w"], conditions=["w > 0"], real_only=True)
# [{'w': 50000.0000000000}] -- 50 krad/s
```

It returns a list of solutions, each a dict, empty when there is none.
`er()` returns one expression rather than a result, so hand it over
under the name the card gives it:

```python
z = er("c,1,0,c:r1,1,2,10:l,2,0,5'm", "1", "0", domain="ac",
       omega="2*pi*2e3")
solve({"zeq": z}, ["im(zeq) = 0"], ["c"], real_only=True)
# [{'c': 1.23522615159288e-6}]
```

**Plotting** is SymPy's `plot()` for a transient (with the package's
own `t`, see the section above) and `bode_samples()` or
`time_samples()` with Matplotlib for anything else. The repository's
`notebooks/quickstart.ipynb` walks through all of this, and
`notebooks/the_monograph.ipynb` runs the exemplar circuits of *The
Internal Logic of Symbulator*; both are executed, and both open in
Colab. `notebooks/books/` holds more: one notebook per built-in example
book of the app (the tutorial's problems, the Alexander & Sadiku and
Nilsson & Riedel samplers), *A Baker's Dozen*, and the Manual's circuits,
each run with the package and compared with the app answer by answer.

## Expert mode: `ex()`

A single dispatcher over `dc`/`ac`/`fd`/`tr`, for callers that want to
pick the analysis type dynamically rather than calling a specific
function -- ports `ex()`. On the calculator this interactively asked
"1:DC 2:AC 3:FD 4:TR"; as a library there's no prompt to answer, so
`domain` is just a normal argument (the word, or the calculator's own
1-4 shorthand):

```python
ex("e1,1,0,5:r1,1,2,1'k:r2,2,0,1'k", domain="dc")
ex("e1,1,0,5:r1,1,0,100", domain="ac", omega=1000)   # omega required for ac
ex("l1,0,2,0.2,3:r1,2,0,100", domain="tr", variables=["i_l1"])
```

Expert mode's "Add equations / Add unknowns / Add conditions" prompts
are ported as keyword arguments, available on `ex()` and on
`dc`/`ac`/`fd`/`tr` directly:

```python
# Design problem: what r_b makes the divider output exactly 6 V?
res = dc("e1,1,0,12:r1,1,2,4'k:r2,2,0,r_b",
         equations=["v_2 = 6"], unknowns=["r_b"])
res.values["r_b"]        # 4000

# Derived quantity: a new symbol in an equation is auto-added as an
# unknown, so no unknowns list is needed for this style.
res = dc("e1,1,0,12:r1,1,2,4'k:r2,2,0,2'k", equations=["pout = v_2*i_r2"])

# Conditions -- the TI's "|" (with) operator: substitutions applied to
# the whole system at solve time.
res = dc("e1,1,0,vin:r1,1,2,r_a:r2,2,0,r_b",
         conditions=["vin = 12", "r_a = 4'k", "r_b = 2'k"])
```

Extra equations run through the same unit-prefix expander as circuit
values (so `6*4'k` works), and accept either `lhs = rhs` strings or a
bare expression (treated as `expr = 0`). A symbolic *component value*
you want solved (like `r_b` above) must be listed in `unknowns` -- the
solver otherwise treats it as a fixed parameter, matching the
original's separate "Add unknowns" prompt.

**If a solve leaves some values symbolic instead of resolving to plain
numbers**, the usual cause is one fewer independent equation than
unknowns: count the symbols in `unknowns=` and make sure there's a
matching equation for each, using every given/measured fact from the
problem rather than only the ones that seem to describe the unknown
you're focused on. A resistor's own equation (`V = R * I`) is nonlinear
once both are unknown, which can occasionally make a fully-specified
system harder to resolve symbolically in one call than the equation
count alone would suggest; if that happens, solving the unknowns by
hand from the given facts and then re-running the circuit with plain
numbers is a reliable fallback.

## Scope: what's simplified vs. the calculator version

- **`pf()`** is ported as the calculator had it (#430): a complex value
  gives the ratio alone, an element's name with its `Result` gives the
  value and the word, read by the element's kind. Until 0.6.8 it took a
  voltage and a current instead and left the source's sign flip to the
  caller.
- **`fd()`** requires s-domain source values, as the calculator's does;
  the `{...}` shorthand converts a time-domain one where you write it.
  `tr()` reads its sources in the time domain, also as the calculator's
  does. (Before 0.5.5 neither transformed anything -- see above.)
- **No interactive prompts anywhere** -- everything the calculator asked
  for via `RequestStr` (analysis type, which answers to save, expert-mode
  custom equations, two-port parameter values, etc.) is a plain function
  argument here instead.
- **No `Disp` progress narration** -- the calculator printed step-by-step
  status messages during a simulation; this port just returns the
  answer.

## Tests

```
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest symbulator/tests
```

The suite is 26 files under `symbulator/tests/`. Rather than quote a count
here, which goes stale with every release, run `pytest symbulator/tests -q`
and read its last line. Two parts of it skip themselves unless an optional
package is present:

- **`test_spice_groundtruth.py`** checks the SPICE exporter against
  [ahkab](https://github.com/ahkab/ahkab), an independent circuit
  simulator, by running each exported netlist and comparing node voltages.
  It is the one test that can catch a sign convention written
  symmetrically into both halves of a round trip. ahkab is GPL-licensed
  and is deliberately **not** a dependency of this MIT package, not even
  in the `test` extra, so install it separately (`pip install ahkab`) to
  run these. Nothing else in the package imports it.
- **`test_notebook.py`**'s cell-magic test needs IPython (`pip install
  ipython`, or the `notebook` extra).

What the files cover:

- **The engine and its answers:** `test_circuits.py` (textbook circuits
  with known answers, all element kinds), `test_controlled_sources.py`,
  `test_coupling.py` and `test_coupling_checks.py` (mutual inductance),
  `test_four_node_ports.py` and `test_twoport_params.py` (transformers and
  two-ports), `test_ports_islands.py` (local references behind a port),
  `test_ac_power_names.py`, `test_angle.py` (polar phasors),
  `test_symbols.py` and `test_suffix.py` (names, reserved symbols, unit
  suffixes), `test_step_impulse.py`.
- **The analyses and tools:** `test_laplace.py` (`t2s`/`s2t`/`tr`),
  `test_equiv.py` (`th`/`er`/`port`), `test_dispatch.py`, `test_expert.py`
  and `test_tr_expert.py` (expert mode), `test_pf.py`, `test_cards.py`
  (`evaluate`/`solve`), `test_plotting.py`, `test_byhand.py` and
  `test_branches.py` (the by-hand nodal and mesh systems).
- **Translation and output:** `test_spice.py` and
  `test_spice_groundtruth.py`, `test_schematic.py`, `test_notebook.py`.

Every push runs the suite on Python 3.9 to 3.14 through GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/tests.yml`).
