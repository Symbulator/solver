"""The calculator's spellings for the step and the impulse.

Versions 7 and 8 write a step as `u(t)` and an impulse with a Greek delta.
Version 9 parses through SymPy, which knows neither, so a description
copied from the older documentation failed with "'Symbol' object is not
callable". These accept both spellings unchanged.

`u` is also the micro prefix, and the rule that separates them is whether
a `(` follows: `7u` is micro, `7u(t)` is the function. That means a bare
`u` is left alone entirely, so it still works as an ordinary variable --
unlike the names in `_allowed_namespace`, which are taken from everyone.
