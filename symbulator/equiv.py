"""
Equivalent-circuit and two-port-extraction tools: ports `th()`, `er()`,
and `port()`.

All three work by adding one or two *test* excitations to a copy of the
given circuit description and re-running the existing `dc`/`ac` engine
-- no new circuit physics, just orchestration on top of Phase 1.

`er()` and `port()` use symbolic test-source values and extract the
answer by substitution after a single solve, mirroring how the original
TI-Basic used the test sources' own names as their (initially undefined,
i.e. symbolic) values and read off ratios/derivatives after the fact.

All three accept the expert-mode `equations`/`unknowns`/`conditions` and
pass them to every round they run. The original barred expert mode from
these tools; nothing about the physics required that, only that the
orchestration below had not been given the arguments to pass on. See
`th()` for the one case where "every round" is the wrong answer.
