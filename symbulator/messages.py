The one place the package's words live.

Roberto's ruling, 31 Aug 2026:

    Let's standardise the error format. Let's modify the package this one
    time, so that all messages, warnings, errors, etc, are returned in a
    structured manner, with a message code and arguments. When I think
    about the package, I do not worry about readability by humans. I do
    not expect any human to use the package directly. The package is
    meant to be under the hood. So, create a running list of all the
    messages shared by the package, give each a number and a format for
    it to pass the arguments (variables, numbers) needed to communicate
    this message to the human, and let the interface do the work of
    putting the message into words.

This is #199, the third and last of the three items that carry it out --
after #198 did `eqsheet.py` (9xx) and #200 did `symbulator_ui.py` (8xx),
both of which proved the shape on surfaces where a mistake costs a
redeploy rather than a version number that can never be reused.

**Three rules, and they outlive any particular message.**

* **A code is permanent once published.** Never reused, never
  renumbered; a retired code stays retired. The same rule as the item
  numbers in NEXT.md, for the same reason: someone quoting "E214" in a
  bug report should mean one thing forever. Gaps in the numbering are
  normal and are not to be tidied.
* **Severity is a field, not a range.** A warning and an error about the
  same thing want one code, not two.
* **The English stays here.** It is the generation source for the app's
  `i18n/en.json`, it is what a traceback or a bug report can quote, and
  a second hand-kept copy in a JSON file is precisely the drift this
  scheme exists to prevent.

**Ranges follow the modules**, because that is how the package already
divides:

    1xx  reserved for parsing (si_prefix's own exceptions; see below)
    2xx  elements.py     -- descriptions, names, nodes, two-port terms
    3xx  engine.py       -- stamping, solving, conditions
    4xx  laplace.py      -- t2s / s2t and the bracket shorthand
    5xx  equiv.py        -- Thevenin, Norton, equivalents
    6xx  spice.py        -- the netlist translator

**What is deliberately not here yet.** `spice.py`'s *warnings* -- the
seventeen `warnings.append` sites -- are **#211**. They looked like
seventeen messages and are not: seven are `f"{el.name}: {why}"` where
`why` comes from elsewhere, `skip()` alone has seven distinct reasons,
and the `described` map names eleven element kinds. Coding them properly
is thirty-odd more codes, and the SPICE translator's wording was, when
this was written, the most likely in the package to change (it was
labelled beta in the app until #340). A code is permanent; prose still
settling is not. So they wait.

`si_prefix.py`'s `AmbiguousValueError` and `UnsafeExpressionError` are
their own classes with their own contract and are not CircuitError; 1xx
is held for them.

**Slots are `%{name}`**, matching `symbulator_ui.py` and `eqsheet.py`,
so that the app has one renderer for all three catalogues rather than
three.
