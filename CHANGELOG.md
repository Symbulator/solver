# Changelog

## 0.6.18 -- 1 Oct 2026 (#470, #471: out of beta, and ready for review)

No change to any answer: nothing under `symbulator/` moved but one comment
and the version number. This release exists so that PyPI's page carries the
new classifier and README.

- **Out of beta (#471).** Symbulator 9 left the beta it had been in since its
  public launch on 28 Aug 2026; the classifier is now
  `Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable`, and Python 3.13 and 3.14 are
  listed beside 3.9–3.12.
- **The repository, ready for review (#470).** A GitHub Actions workflow runs
  the suite on Python 3.9 to 3.14, with the ahkab ground-truth tests in a job
  of their own; `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CITATION.cff`
  added; the JOSS paper and its fact-check in `paper/`.
- **README.** The *Tests* section names the command that counts the suite
  instead of a count that had gone stale ("48 tests across six files"; there
  are 26 files), and says why the ahkab and IPython tests skip in a plain
  install. Two sentences that still said a side of the circuit behind a port
  is "reported floating" now say it is given a local reference, as it has
  been since 0.5.32. The quick start's transient uses `1'u`, so the printed
  answer matches its comment exactly. Install names the Python versions and
  the extras.

## 0.6.17 -- 20 Sep 2026 (#466: evaluate() and solve(), the app's two cards)

### Added
- **`evaluate(result, "expression")` and `solve(result, equations,
  unknowns)`** -- the app's Evaluate box and Solve card as package
  functions, so a notebook can do what the calculator did with a solved
  circuit's variables: `evaluate(res, "vo/vs")`, `evaluate(res, "vc",
  conditions=["t = 2"])`, `solve(res, ["im(ze) = 0"], ["w"],
  conditions=["w > 0"], real_only=True)`. Both return SymPy and read
  answer names in every spelling (`i_r1`, `ir1`, `IR1`), with the same
  shorthand a circuit value gets (`2'k`, `^`, `u(t)`, `{...}` in FD).
  `evaluate` also answers `pf(...)`, `s2t(...)`/`t2s(...)` and
  `limit(...)` with the answers substituted in first, takes a condition at
  infinity as a limit, and on a `th()` result knows the load answers
  `irl`, `vrl` and `prl` in the variable `load`. `solve` reads a pinning
  condition (`R_3 = 10`) as a substitution and a comparison as a filter on
  the roots, and `real_only=True` is the calculator's `solve()` against
  its `cSolve()`. A `port()` result and a plain mapping of names to values
  are accepted too, the latter being how `er()`'s single expression is
  handed over. New module `symbulator/cards.py`; nothing else changes.
- **`Result.desc`**, the circuit a result was solved from. It lets
  `cards.py` derive an element's voltage drop from the two nodes it spans,
  which in fd and tr is not among `values` -- the third level is computed
  for dc and ac only -- so `vc` names an answer on the app's page while
  the package had no such key.
- **Notebooks.** `notebooks/books/` holds one executed notebook per built-in
  example book (the Course's problems, the two textbook samplers, the
  Showcase and the monograph's exemplars), *A Baker's Dozen*, and the
  Manual's circuits, each generated from the app's own files and compared
  with the app answer by answer. Not part of the installed package.

### Fixed
- **`th()`, `er()` and `port()` accept a frequency written as a string**, as
  `ac()` always has: `th(circuit, "2", "0", domain="ac", omega="2*pi*2e3")`
  reached the stamping code as a `str` and failed there with *can't multiply
  sequence by non-int of type ImaginaryUnit*, naming nothing the caller had
  typed. The one place all of them pass through now sympifies it.

## 0.6.16 -- 16 Sep 2026 (#458: th, er and port read `{...}` in FD)

### Fixed
- **`th()`, `er()` and `port()` read a value written in time in curly
  brackets in FD**, as `fd()` always has: `th("e,1,0,{480u(t)}:...", "a",
  "0", "fd")` returns the equivalent of `480/s` instead of refusing the
  description with "contains a set". The extra equations and conditions are
  expanded the same way. Outside FD the brackets are refused as before.
  Found moving NR12's Example 13.6 to the bracketed form (Roberto, 15 Sep
  2026).

## 0.6.15 -- 15 Sep 2026 (#459: a mesh arrow sits in the middle of its loop)

### Fixed
- **A mesh current's arrow sits in the middle of its loop.** It was placed at
  the mean of its elements' midpoints, which leans away from any side of the
  loop that is bare wire: AS7's Practice Problem 13.2 had its left arrow up
  by the two top resistors (Roberto, 15 Sep 2026). The loop is now traced as
  drawn -- its elements and the wires joining them, on a 4px grid -- and the
  arrow goes to the point inside it farthest from every line, symbol, label
  and earlier arrow, its circle sized to the room there. A by-hand mesh comes
  from a cycle basis and may enclose several windows of the drawing, which is
  why the loop's own path is traced rather than a window looked up.
- The search runs once, on the returned picture: the layout is still settled
  with the quick placement, so every drawing keeps its size and layout, and a
  drawing with no marks is byte-identical to 0.6.14.

## 0.6.14 -- 15 Sep 2026 (#451: mesh currents turn clockwise, and can be flipped)

### Added
- **`schematic.mesh_turning(desc, marks)`** reports which way each mesh of a
  by-hand run turns in the drawing, and **`byhand.reverse_meshes(system,
  names)`** turns the named meshes the other way: every written line and
  bridge line takes `Ik -> -Ik`, the loop is walked backwards, and every
  answer but the reversed mesh currents is unchanged. The app uses the two
  to turn every mesh clockwise, as textbooks draw them, and to flip them
  all at the reader's request (Roberto, 15 Sep 2026).

### Fixed
- **A mesh's arrow runs the way its equations do.** `_orient` turned a
  mesh by negating its signs and kept its order, and the drawing reads an
  arrow's sense from the order, so a turned mesh could be written one way
  and drawn the other. It is now walked backwards. The sense is also read
  from each element's ends along the walk rather than from the midpoints,
  which gave a loop of two parallel elements no area at all. Found on
  Alexander & Sadiku 7e's Example 3.7, whose second mesh was drawn
  clockwise and written counterclockwise.
- **A riser no longer climbs through a lifted body (#453).** A branch
  lifted over a node drew its body centred on its span, so a riser of a
  branch lifted higher could rise straight through the symbol: Alexander &
  Sadiku 7e's Example 10.4 put its 8 ohm across l-c exactly where the 6 ohm
  across t-r rises from t. The body now sits in the widest stretch clear of
  such risers, stopping short of them so the crossing is a hop and not a
  junction. Only a riser through the body moves it; a riser crossing a
  lead was always a hop and stays one. One drawing of the 459 in the
  example books moves, that one, and no monograph exemplar does.

## 0.6.13 -- 14 Sep 2026 (#450: a name with two digits and a letter)

### Fixed
- **An element named like `r20b` is accepted.** The implicit
  multiplication that reads `2ir3` as `2*ir3` looked behind a number for
  a letter only, so in `r20b` the match that `r` stopped at `2` started
  again at `0`, and the element was refused with a message naming
  `r20*b`, a name the reader never typed. The rule now refuses a digit
  or a decimal point behind the number too. `r20a` had only ever escaped
  because `20a` also reads as twenty atto. The same fix reaches a value:
  `3*ir20b` no longer reads as `3*ir20*b`. Found writing Alexander &
  Sadiku 7e's Example 3.7 for the Course.

## 0.6.12 -- 14 Sep 2026 (#446: a coupling given as k is captioned as k)

### Fixed
- **A drawing captions a coupling typed as its factor as that factor.**
  `m,l1,l2,k=0.65` drew the caption *M = k=0.65 (couples L1 and L2)*:
  the drawer parses in echo mode, where the typed field is the element's
  value, and passed the whole `k=0.65` through as if it were an
  inductance. It now reads *k = 0.65 (couples L1 and L2)*, the way the
  reader wrote it and the book states it; a coupling given as an
  inductance keeps its *M = ...* caption. Found by drawing Nilsson &
  Riedel 12e's Problem 18.36 for the Course; Roberto's ruling of 14 Sep
  2026 that with a k the *M =* is dropped. Drawing only -- no answer
  changes.

## 0.6.11 -- 13 Sep 2026 (#441: the AC powers are p, q and s)

### Changed
- **In AC every element reports `p_<name>`, `q_<name>` and `s_<name>` --
  P, Q and S as every book writes them -- under both conventions.** `p`
  is Re(S), the average (real) power; `q`, new, is Im(S), the reactive
  power, in vars; `s` keeps its half under peak phasors, as every book
  defines it. The calculator named the average `ap` with peak phasors
  and `p` with RMS ones, so a name existed in one setting and not the
  other; now `p` is the name in both, and `ap_<name>` stays as an alias
  of it for the calculator habit -- present in the answers, never shown
  on a card. Roberto's decision of 13 Sep 2026, after the alternatives
  were put to him: Q is an amplitude, not an average, so *ap* beside
  *q* named the two unevenly. DC is untouched. `q` joins the answer-name
  aliases, so `qr1` reads as `q_r1`.

## 0.6.10 -- 13 Sep 2026 (#438: the m line checked, and k= accepted)

### Added
- **A coupling may be given as its factor**: `m,l1,l2,k=0.5` is
  expanded at parse time to `k*sqrt(L1*L2)` for coils in henries and
  to `j*k*sqrt(|Z1|*|Z2|)` for coils written as impedances in ohms, so
  the engine never sees k. A numeric k must lie in (0, 1]; a symbolic
  k gives a symbolic coupling. The letter is case-insensitive and
  spaces round the `=` are allowed.

### Changed
- **In AC the real power answers to both of its names.** `p_<name>` and
  `ap_<name>` are one answer, the real part of `s_<name>`, whatever the
  convention; the calculator's naming -- `ap` with peak phasors, `p` with
  RMS ones -- had left `pr1 + pe1` an unevaluated expression under the
  default convention (#439, Roberto, 13 Sep 2026).
- **The m line is checked before anything is stamped** (codes
  222-228). Both named elements must exist and be of one kind -- two
  inductors in henries or two impedances in ohms, never one of each,
  which was accepted before and answered wrongly. A numeric value on
  either coil or on the coupling must be real and positive in henries
  and positive imaginary in ohms; a symbol passes. With everything
  numeric the coupling may not exceed `sqrt(L1*L2)`, a coupling
  factor of 1. And a pair written in ohms is coupled in AC only: in
  TR and FD the coupling was silently dropped, since `r` couples
  nothing outside AC.

## 0.6.9 -- 13 Sep 2026 (#430: the pf tool as version 8 has it)

### Changed
- **`pf()` takes one value, as the calculator's did, and its two forms
  are the calculator's two forms.** `pf(res["s_e"])` -- a complex power,
  an impedance, any complex value, symbolic or not -- returns |Re| / |S|
  and no direction, since a bare number cannot say leading from lagging:
  the calculation is done on the value as given, which for `s_e` is the
  power the source *consumes*, and consumed or delivered the ratio is
  the same. `pf("e", res)` -- an element's name with the AC `Result` it
  belongs to -- returns the sentence version 8 printed,
  `pf: 0.97342 leading`, and reads the word the way version 8 read it: a
  load (`r`, and in version 9 `l` and `c`) on the power it *consumes*, a
  source (`e`, `j`) on the power it *delivers*, the current negated
  first, so a source reports the power factor of the circuit it sees.
  The port shipped in 0.5.x took a voltage and a current instead and
  left the negating to the caller, which the README had to warn about;
  the warning is gone with the reason for it. A symbol in the value is
  taken as real, as the calculator takes it, so `pf(x + 2*I)` is
  `Abs(x)/sqrt(x**2 + 4)` in the caller's own `x`.

## 0.6.8 -- 12 Sep 2026 (#426: a coupled pair written as impedances)

### Fixed
- **A coupled pair written as impedances gets a local reference, as one
  written in henries always did.** `m` names two elements, and in AC a
  coil is normally written as an impedance in ohms -- `m,r2,r3,3j` is
  the tutorial's own idiom and eight of Lesson 10's entries use it. The
  island check added with #322/#323 recognised a coupling only when the
  coupled elements were `l`, so the far side of an `r`-spelled pair was
  reported as floating and the circuit refused, while the identical
  circuit in henries solved and reported its local reference in note
  221. The two spellings now agree: same note, same reference node, and
  every shared answer identical to the last digit. A genuinely stray
  piece -- one no `m` names -- is still refused as before.

## 0.6.7 -- 12 Sep 2026 (#423: the drawing restyled on Nilsson & Riedel)

### Changed
- **The schematic's symbols, stroke weights, label face and colours
  are Nilsson & Riedel's** (*Electric Circuits*, 12th edition),
  measured from the book's own vector figures rather than eyeballed --
  the geometry block in `schematic.py` names the figure each number was
  read from. One point of the book is 1.6 px of the drawing. Wires at
  0.5 pt and every symbol body at 0.75 pt; the independent
  source a 10.5 pt circle with the + and - *inside* it and the current
  arrow's filled head; the dependent source a diamond 27 pt along the
  element and 16 pt across; the capacitor 13 pt plates 6 pt apart, one
  of them bowed inward, with no polarity sign (Roberto's condition);
  the op-amp 36 pt tall with its pins 8 pt off the axis; junction dots
  of radius 2 pt.
- **Four of the book's choices were overruled on sight** and are not
  the book's: the resistor is the rounded six-segment zigzag of 0.5.26
  exactly as it was, not the book's sharp seven-segment one; the
  capacitor is a fifth larger than the book's (`CAP_SCALE`), so that
  the largest symbol is ten times the smallest by area as before
  rather than fourteen; the op-amp is equilateral rather than the
  book's longer triangle; and the ground keeps its three bars, at the
  body weight, rather than the book's filled triangle.
  Labels in a Times face at 14 px with 0.7-size subscripts: values
  upright with a space before the unit, names italic with a digit
  subscript upright and a letter subscript italic, and the reference
  quantities a dependent source reads -- the arrow, its label, the
  drop's signs -- in the book's blue, `var(--schematic-ref, #005b7f)`.
- **The inductor is not the book's.** Roberto kept his looping coil
  (*"I prefer my inductor symbol, with curls as it stands today"*); it
  is scaled uniformly to the book's inductor length and nothing else
  about it changed. The transformer's windings are that coil too.
- `LEAD_MIN` 34 -> 26 and `ROW_H_MIN` 96 -> 86, the book's leads and
  band. Nothing in the layout logic changed: over the 356 built-in
  drawings crossings (17), bends (359), wires (1334) and dots (881) are
  identical before and after, and the canvas area is 95.7% of before.
- `_text_width` is the one width estimate, from the face's own advance
  widths per character, used by the canvas, by `_runs_width` and by
  `tools/review_schematics.py`; the 7.2 px average it replaces was the
  old sans face's.
- The label metrics (`LABEL_ASCENT` 9.75, `LABEL_DESCENT` 3.0,
  `CAP_DESCENT` 2.0, `SUB_DY` 2.9) were re-measured in headless Chrome
  for the new face and size, with the method of `pixel_clearance.py`.

## 0.6.6 -- 11 Sep 2026 (#392: a chained comparison is a condition)

### Fixed
- **`7 > vx > 3` is accepted as a condition.** It is how anyone writes a
  range, and it was refused: `_parse_inequality` split on the first
  operator it met, so the second half reached `safe_sympify` as the
  *value* `vx > 3`, which the syntax gate rightly refuses -- the error
  said "contains a comparison, which is not arithmetic", naming the half
  rather than the whole. A chain is now the conjunction of its links, in
  either direction and over any number of them, and
  `_filter_solutions` substitutes and simplifies an `And` exactly as it
  does a single relation, so nothing downstream changed.
- `split_chained_comparison(text)` is the split, exported so the two
  parsers in the app (the Solve card's and the Evaluate card's, which
  had the same fault) import it instead of growing a third and a fourth
  copy. Malformed text comes back whole, so each caller still reports a
  bad condition in its own words.

## 0.6.5 -- 11 Sep 2026 (#373-#379: the drawer relaxes, and six rules from a review)

Roberto Perez-Franco reviewed the example book drawing by drawing on
10-11 Sep 2026. Every item below is written as a rule, with the drawing
that found it as evidence rather than as the subject.

### Changed
- **The band and the column gaps close to what a drawing needs (#373).**
  `ROW_H` and `COL_W` were constants, so a drawing of one source and two
  resistors was laid out on the same grid as a three-phase network:
  measured over the 356 built-in drawings, the median one carried 113px
  of air in the band between the node row and the ground rail, and 95px
  in every column gap. Both now close, by a measuring pass rather than a
  model -- the drawing is rendered at full size, asked what actually
  stands in it, and redrawn. Roberto's balloon deflates as well as
  inflating.

  The vertical needs one number for the whole band, because every gap in
  it closes at the same rate; the horizontal needs one per gap and then a
  short relaxation, because two labels at the same height need the sum of
  their widths and not the larger of them. A tightening is kept only when
  `(crossings, bends, wires)` is unchanged and nothing new collides, so
  the worst case is the uniform grid it started from.

- **The independent source symbol is 10% larger (#374).** `SRC_R` 15.0 ->
  16.5, at Roberto's ask. The dependent source's diamond is held where it
  was, so the two are now the same size.

- **Both of an op-amp's input legs bend at the same distance (#375).**
  Of the book's 78 op-amps, not one had legs of equal length. 58 have a
  reason -- the lower input drops to the rail, or carries a captured
  source drawn in that drop, and either needs a column clear of the upper
  input's riser. For the other 20 one leg's turn was its node's own
  column and the other's was a bare constant; the arbitrary one now
  matches the determined one. No bend is added, because both legs already
  bent. Three drawings lose a bend, three lose a stray dot, two lose
  crowding and three lose a wire.

- **A junction dot goes where three lines meet on the page, not in the
  netlist (#376).** The dot pass marked a node's column whenever three
  or more elements touched that node, whether or not three lines met
  there -- so TR5's Example 4-13 carried two dots 14.5px apart for one
  junction, the second being a plain corner. It now counts lines: ending
  at the point counts once, passing through twice, and three is where a
  dot is earned. Collinear runs are merged first, or the count is of
  segments rather than of lines. Across the book, 942 junction dots ->
  881, and drawings carrying a dot where fewer than three lines meet:
  56 -> 0.

- **A node lifts to meet a raised op-amp's input (#377).** The input
  leaves `OP_H/4` above the node row, so the node's own wire dropped that
  far to meet it -- a corner and a spur. The node now rises to the pin
  and the line runs straight in. Only where nothing else needs the row:
  three of the book's five raised op-amps qualify.

- **A cramped return gets a column, and joins the lead rather than the
  corner (#378).** An under-routed input returning to a node that has a
  grounded element on its own column could not tee onto that column --
  the wire below the body is the ground side of it -- so it dodged 30px
  left and ran back along a lane 16px under the row. It now claims a
  spacer column before that node and tees straight onto the arriving
  element's lead. Six drawings, each losing a bend, a wire, a
  near-corner join and two crowded pairs.

- **A label keeps clear of every line that is not its own element's
  (#379).** A label may sit close to its own element -- `GAP` is exactly
  that -- and the complaint was about everything else. Labels now carry
  the axis of the element that drew them, and the relaxation widens the
  gaps until an unrelated line is far enough away. Exactly one drawing in
  356 was closer than 12px; it was 4.7px and is now 22.7px.

- **Where the price list cannot separate two placements, the smaller
  finished drawing wins.** Size is the last term, never the first:
  measured against the drawings Roberto ruled on when he accepted 0.6.4,
  an objective that puts size first contradicts him on 19 of 22. It is
  measured on the finished drawing, since the band and the gaps close
  afterwards and the two orderings can disagree.

### Unchanged
- Crossings. All 17 in the book are where they were, including the four
  Roberto has ruled unavoidable.

Over the example book: bends 372 -> 359, near-corner joins 10 -> 3,
dots where fewer than three lines meet 64 -> 0, crowded pairs 140 -> 125,
wires 1346 -> 1334, and total canvas area 75.8% of before. All 356
drawings move; three are larger than before, each one where #378 bought
a column to uncramp a return.

## 0.6.4 -- 10 Sep 2026 (#367-#369: the op-amp drawings, chosen by cost rather than by rule)

### Changed
- **A drawing with a choice is now drawn every way and the cheapest kept
  (#367).** The only choice the drawer has is where each op-amp stands,
  and a hand-written predicate for it got AS2's Practice Problem 5.9
  wrong in both directions over most of a day. `_cost` prices a finished
  drawing -- crossings, then bends, then wires, compared in that order,
  because "every bend costs money, and every cross costs a lot of money"
  (Roberto Perez-Franco, 10 Sep 2026) -- and `_render` keeps the best.
  Over the example book it agrees with every layout he has ruled on.

  The winner is drawn again at the end so that it is the last thing on
  the canvas: the review harness and the editable-drawing exporter both
  read the canvas by hooking `_flush_wires`, and a hook sees the last
  pass, not the returned one.

- **A follower claims a column of its own (#367).** An op-amp whose
  output *is* one of its inputs, `o1,1,2,2`, names one node twice, so it
  spanned no columns and the ordering had nowhere to put its body -- the
  symbol is drawn to the right of that column regardless, and landed in
  the gap the next stage occupies. Practice Problem 5.9 drew its two
  triangles 35px into each other.

- **A lead leaves toward its destination (#369).** An op-amp's lower
  input always exited 30px to the *left* of its input column, whatever
  side its node was on. Where the node lies right, that walked past the
  previous stage and turned back across all of it: 137px the wrong way
  and 396px back in Practice Problem 5.9, and both of that drawing's
  crossings were on the westward leg.

- **A body stands at the output end of a stretched span (#369).** The
  triangle was centred between its input and output columns, which is
  right for a one-column span and wrong for one widened by a spacer:
  it left 107px of bare output lead and parked the body against its
  neighbour, leaving 31px for two verticals that then ran 3px apart.

- **A third place to stand: above the node row (#369).** When an
  op-amp's own feedback resistor occupies its span on the row, the row
  is not available -- but the strip above it is, and from there all
  three connections are short drops. Offered as an option and priced
  like the others. The input whose node lies further right takes the
  upper pin, so the symbol comes out with `+` uppermost; that is a
  consequence of which lead has room, not a rule.

### Fixed
- **An above-row body no longer stands in a lifted element's row
  (#369).** The strip above the node row is not empty: a stacked element
  sits one `stack_h` up per level, and Bo2's Drill Exercise 3.4 drew
  `r1` straight through the body. The placement now demands its strip be
  clear, the same question `_raise_ok` asks of the node row.

- **A lead routed past a body clears the body's *name* (#369).** Since
  #338 an op-amp's name is set against its own hypotenuse, so it already
  stands above the top vertex; a lead 12px over the vertex passed 1.6px
  over the name, in every drawing that stands a body above the row.

- **An element inside a four-terminal block is caught wherever it sits
  (#366).** `spans_idx` now registers two-ports and transformers, so a
  grounded element hanging off one of their own top nodes is bumped to a
  column of its own instead of landing inside the box.

## 0.6.3 -- 9 Sep 2026 (#344: an island's reference is zero everywhere, including in the answers derived from it)

### Fixed
- **A derived answer could name an island's reference node instead of
  the zero it is (#344).** On
  `e1,1,0,10:r1,1,2,4:t,[2,0],[3,4],[1,2]:r2,3,4,8` the same result
  reported `v_4 = 0` and, two lines later, `v_r2 = 20/3 - v_4` and
  `p_r2 = 50/9 - 5*v_4/6`. The third level (`v_<name>`, `p_<name>`,
  `s_<name>`, `r_<name>`, `z_<name>`) reads node voltages out of the
  solved dict, and an island's reference is never an unknown --
  `Circuit.v()` hands back the literal 0 -- so it was not in that dict
  until the reference loop put it there, which happened *after*. The
  loop now runs first. Confined to `dc` and `ac`, the only domains that
  compute a third level; `th()`, `er()` and `port()` were unaffected.

  A regression from 0.5.32/0.5.33 rather than an old bug: before those,
  every island was refused outright, so the set of references was always
  just `{"0"}` and the ground-only special case was complete. The
  answers were right as expressions and unreduced as answers -- the
  expression above *is* 50/9 at `v_4 = 0`.

### Changed
- **`byhand`'s module documentation.** It still opened "Symbulator X
  only, experimental", which 0.6.0 ended, and still listed
  transformers, two-port blocks and mutual inductance as refused by
  both methods, which 0.6.1's augmented method ended. It now records
  which method takes which, and quotes no sweep counts: those move
  whenever an example book gains an entry or a refusal becomes support,
  and `tools/check_byhand.py` is the thing to re-run.

## 0.6.2 -- 8 Sep 2026 (#335, #337, #338: the by-hand line, and two op-amp drawings)

### Changed
- **A by-hand run says which method wrote the equations (#335).**
  `byhand.lead()` returns that sentence for the system in hand and
  `byhand.technique()` returns whether it needed a supernode or a
  supermesh, and how many -- or `None`, which is the point: a circuit
  with no voltage source between two non-reference nodes has no
  supernode in it, and saying otherwise describes the method rather
  than the circuit. Six new codes, 741-746.
- **The shorter-route sentences carry no noun the number must agree
  with (718-720).** "Mesh analysis writes %{mesh} equations" read
  "writes 1 equations" in 53 of the tutorial's 210 eligible circuits;
  it now reads "mesh needs 1, nodal 3".
- **An op-amp's non-inverting input is routed under the body when its
  node lies to the right (#337).** It used to leave the pin going left,
  climb to 16px under the node row and run the whole width back across
  the riser it had just left. It now drops into a band of its own below
  the body -- `OP_UNDER_H`, added to a drawing only when one is needed
  -- and rises beside the node's column, teeing 16px under the row.
  That height matters: a tee lower down would be on the *ground* side of
  whatever hangs from that node to the rail, which is a different node
  and a picture of a different circuit. Measured over the nine circuits
  it applies to, the tee clears the hanging body by 62px.
- **The op-amp's name is set against its own sloping edge (#338).**
  Above a triangle the nearest ink is the hypotenuse, not the top
  vertex, so a name cleared from the vertex floats a quarter of the
  symbol's height from anything.

### Fixed
- **An op-amp recorded its bounding box as ink, not its wedge (#338).**
  `tools/review_schematics.py` reads exactly those rectangles, so a
  label in the empty notch above the hypotenuse counted as sitting on
  the symbol -- 58 findings the moment the name moved, every one the
  model's fault. The wedge is now a staircase of bands that encloses
  the triangle and never cuts into it. The keep-out for *wires* is
  still the full box.

## 0.6.1 -- 8 Sep 2026 (#332: the augmented method)

### Added
- **Every circuit in the tutorial now has a by-hand system.** A current
  that cannot be written in the method's own unknowns is carried as an
  extra unknown, and its element's own relation stands as an extra
  equation -- one equation for one unknown, so the system stays square.
  Coupled coils go to mesh, which is the form the engine already writes
  a coupled inductor's drop in and the reason textbooks teach coupled
  coils in the mesh chapter; transformers and two-port blocks go to
  nodal, carrying their terminal currents and defining relations.
  Op-amps in mesh stay refused, correctly. Circuits with no method at
  all: 16 before, none after. Three codes, 737, 739 and 740.

### Fixed
- **A four-terminal two-port registered its bracketed pair as a node.**
  `stamp_all`'s reference closure excluded `t` but not the other port
  kinds, so `pr(1,0)` became a node with an unconstrained `v_` unknown
  and a `0 = 0` KCL. Harmless to the classic solve, which is why it had
  gone unnoticed since #314, and fatal to anything that counts
  equations.
- **A two-port's bracketed parameters reach a read-back branch.** They
  arrive as conditions rather than through `Circuit(params=...)`, so
  `branches.stamped` applies those bindings itself; without them a
  by-hand system carried free `z111` symbols while the classic solve
  carried the numbers.

## 0.6.0 -- 8 Sep 2026 (#329: by-hand nodal and mesh systems)

### Added
- **`byhand.py`: a second system for the same circuit, written the way
  a first course teaches it.** KCL in node voltages with supernodes, or
  KVL in mesh currents with supermeshes; solved separately and always
  compared with the classic solve, which stays the authority. It states
  no component rule of its own -- it runs the real `Circuit.stamp_all()`
  and reads each branch's v-i relation back out of the equations the
  engine produced, by differentiation, through the new `branches.py`, so
  a domain rule added to `engine.py` appears there for free and the two
  cannot drift.
- **`schematic.to_svg(desc, marks=...)`**, an opt-in overlay: the nodes
  whose KCL is written, dashed enclosures round each supernode and
  supermesh, and the mesh currents curling round their own loops.
- **The 7xx message range**, so every sentence the feature produces is
  a code the application renders (#199).

## 0.5.33 -- 7 Sep 2026 (#323: an island behind a coupling)

### Changed
- **The secondary of a coupled pair may float, like a transformer's.** An
  inductor named by an `m` element counts as a coupling's terminal pair,
  so a side of the circuit that reaches the rest only through the coupling
  is an island of the legitimate kind (#322) and gets a reference of its
  own -- the coil's second node -- with the same note, code 221, whose
  text now says *behind a port or a coupling*. Nilsson & Riedel's
  switching problems with coupled coils type as drawn. A dangling coil
  that nothing couples is still floating.

## 0.5.32 -- 7 Sep 2026 (#320, #321, #322: ports that float)

Three items from a reader's three problems (Alexander & Sadiku 19.2,
19.19 and 19.70), none of which has a grounded port.

### Added
- **`port()` takes a port as a node or a `[top,bottom]` pair (#320).**
  `port(cir, "[a,f]", "[e,j]", "z")` extracts the parameters of a ladder
  with resistors in both rails; the two-node form, `port(cir, "1", "2",
  "z")`, is unchanged. Each test source sits across its own port, and the
  port voltage is the difference of its two terminals. Grounding the
  bottoms of a floating port solves a different circuit and returns
  plausible, wrong numbers, which is what this exists to stop.
- **An island behind a port gets a reference of its own (#322).** The far
  side of a transformer or a parameter block that nothing grounds is a
  legitimate circuit whose absolute potentials are undefined; until now
  it was refused as floating. `Result.references` names the node held
  at 0 for each such island (the first port bottom in it, or a caller's
  preferred node -- `port()`, `th()` and `er()` name their ports'
  terminals), `v_<ref>` is reported as 0, and `Result.notes` carries a
  warning, code 221, saying which nodes are measured against which
  reference. A dangling piece of ordinary elements is still refused.
  `parse_circuit`, `solve_circuit` and `_run` take `references=`.
- **Two parameter blocks that overlap in the drawing stack in lanes
  (#321).** A parallel-series connection of two z blocks drew one box
  through the other's parameters; blocks whose spans overlap now sit one
  below the other, the lower one's upper terminals rising to the node
  row, a block whose bottom is another's top drawn above it (the series
  connection), and a block with another beneath it grounding at its own
  faces. Cascades stay in a row. Transformers are unchanged.

### Changed
- A port whose two terminals are the same node, or a pair with more or
  fewer than two entries, is a `ValueError` from `port()`.

## 0.5.31 -- 6 Sep 2026 (#318, decimal rounding)

### Fixed
- **`polar()` and `Result.rounded()` round in decimal, ties away from
  zero.** Both had used `sp.N(x, digits)`, which evaluates at a *binary*
  working precision of about `digits` digits, so the last decimal digit
  could land either side: the monograph's wye-delta line current came out
  `2.350∠-36.21°` where the arithmetic and the book say `-36.20`. The
  value is now evaluated at full precision, read at fifteen decimal
  digits, and rounded with `decimal.ROUND_HALF_UP`, so `31.25` is `31.3`
  as a book prints it (`symbulator._display.round_sig`). Measured over
  the 2,269 numeric answers of the tutorial's rounded examples: the old
  rule misrounded twelve of them.

## 0.5.30 -- 6 Sep 2026 (#315, the package in a notebook)

### Added
- **Results typeset in a notebook.** A `Result`, a `TheveninResult`
  and what `port()` returns carry `_repr_latex_`, so a bare `res` at
  the end of a cell shows every answer as mathematics, one aligned row
  each, the analysis named above; a port result is its 2×2 matrix.
  The imaginary unit is written `j`, every infinity a plain ∞. The
  plain `__repr__` at a terminal is unchanged.
- **The tutorial's spellings.** `res["ir1"]`, `res["v2"]`,
  `"pr1" in res` -- a `Result` answers to the book's names as well as
  the underscored ones it stores (`Result.resolve`). A miss names the
  answers that exist. `Result` also supports `in`, `iter` and `len`.
- **`Result.rounded(digits)`** -- the app's Rounding setting, as a
  copy for display; exact integers stay as they are.
- **`polar()`** -- the app's `aa` mini-tool: a complex value as
  magnitude and angle in degrees, `5∠53.13°`, returned as a `Phasor`
  with `.magnitude`, `.angle` and `complex()` back.
- **Cell magics.** `%load_ext symbulator`, then `%%dc`, `%%ac`,
  `%%fd`, `%%tr` over a circuit typed one element per line: drawn,
  solved and shown. Options on the magic's line (`omega=1000`, `rms`,
  `variables=v_2,i_r1`, `into=res`, `nodraw`). IPython is imported
  only when the extension is loaded.
- **`PortResult`**, a dict subclass, is what `port()` returns; every
  existing use (`params["11"]`) is unchanged.
- **`pip install symbulator[notebook]`** brings JupyterLab, NumPy and
  Matplotlib. `notebooks/quickstart.ipynb` walks through all of the
  above, executed; the README gained an *In a notebook* section.

### Fixed
- `help(dc)` showed `r1,1,2,1k`, an example the package itself rejects
  as ambiguous; it now says `1'k`.

## 0.5.29 -- 6 Sep 2026

### Changed
- **A transformer's internal unknown is no longer an answer.** When a
  winding's top node is also another of the element's terminals
  (`t,[1,0],[2,1]`, the autotransformer as one tapped winding), the
  primary current the system needs steps aside to an internal name so
  the node's answer can be the sum; 0.5.28 reported that internal name
  among the values, where the app showed it under Expert Mode unknowns.
  `Circuit.internal` drops it.
- **A wide turns ratio is printed above the node row.** `80 : 80+120`
  was set between the windings' upper leads, which are 38px apart, and
  ran through both; the pixel harness caught it on AS7's Example 13.11
  at 0.5px. A ratio estimated wider than that gap now goes above the
  row, the name with it; `1 : 2` stays where it was.

## 0.5.28 -- 6 Sep 2026

### Changed
- **A bottom terminal that is the other port's top draws round the far
  side (#314).** `t,[1,0],[2,1],[80,120]`, the autotransformer written
  as one tapped winding, put its second winding's return along the
  block's own top in 0.5.27. The lead now drops below the feet, runs
  under the block and rises on the side its node lies, with a hop where
  it crosses the grounded foot's drop. `_Layout.return_col` decides the
  side for every four-terminal lead by the node's column, which also
  gives a common bottom its one shared line.

## 0.5.27 -- 6 Sep 2026

### Added
- **A transformer or two-port block may name all four terminals
  (#314).** A node term may be a bracketed pair, `[top,bottom]`:
  `t,[tl,bl],[tr,br],[N1,N2]` and `z,[tl,bl],[tr,br],[p11,p12,p21,p22]`
  beside the calculator's `t,n1,n2,N1,N2` and `z,n1,n2[,[...]]`, which
  keep their meaning -- the two-node form is the paired form with both
  bottoms on 0, and the engine treats it exactly so. A transformer's
  turns may also be written as a pair, `t,n1,n2,[N1,N2]`, and must be
  when its nodes are pairs. Each port joins its own two terminals and
  the two ports never conduct across each other, so a side of the
  circuit with no path to node 0 is reported floating (217). A port
  with the same node at both terminals is refused (218); a transformer
  with the wrong shape (219) and a mixed pair-and-bare node term (220)
  say so. `Element.port_nodes`, `four_node`, `turns`, `nodes` and
  `param_idx` read these forms; `_IDENTIFIER_FIELD_IDX` still names the
  node *fields*, which now may hold a pair.
- **The current into every terminal.** A transformer or two-port
  reports `i_<name><node>` for each distinct live terminal, the current
  entering the element there: four in the paired form, two in the
  grounded form. A transformer used to report its primary alone --
  version 8 reported both, and the port had lost the secondary. A node
  named at two terminals reports one sum.
- **SPICE export of the paired forms**: the transformer's E/sense/F
  triple and the two-port's VCCS quartet name each port's pair; an old
  description's netlist is unchanged. Nine paired cases added to the
  ahkab ground truth.

- **The schematic drawer draws the four-terminal forms.** The symbol
  still spans between its two top nodes; each lower terminal leaves its
  face sideways, rises through a clear column the layout keeps beside
  the block, and joins its own node on the row, so the ground rail runs
  beneath uncut. A bottom that is ground still drops to the rail; a
  common bottom joins a transformer's two feet with one wire, and takes
  a block's two leads to one line under the box; `z,[1,0],[2,0]` draws
  exactly as `z,1,2`. The two-node drawing -- the rail cut at a block,
  one ground symbol per run -- is untouched.

## 0.5.26 -- 1 Sep 2026

### Changed
- **The three passive symbols redrawn (#218).** Roberto's brief, from
  reference images, settled one parameter at a time against rendered
  strips rather than described in prose.

  **The resistor's peaks are rounded, not pointed.** Each corner becomes
  a quadratic whose control point is the old vertex, leaving the
  straight run `ZIG_ROUND` back along one arm and rejoining it the same
  distance along the next. A quadratic leaves its first control point
  along the line to the second, so the curve is tangent to both arms:
  no join to see, one continuous stroke that never comes to a point.
  `stroke-linejoin="round"` was the cheap alternative and is not the
  same thing -- its radius is fixed at half a stroke, 0.85px, which is
  the blob #212 rejected.

  Rounding a corner cuts it off, so the **drawn** peak is 6.51px against
  the 7.20 amplitude. That is the number a label must clear, so `REACH`
  is built from it and not from the amplitude: the resistor's labels sit
  2px closer than they did (9.37 -> 7.36). The size did not change --
  a 10% reduction was tried, measured clean, and then withdrawn.

  **The inductor is one line that loops** -- a projected helix, drawn as
  a prolate trochoid `x = A*t - B*sin t`, `y = -H*cos t`, emitted as
  cubic Beziers fitted to the analytic derivative. It loops exactly when
  `B > A`, because that is when `dx/dt` changes sign and the line
  doubles back; at `B == A` it is a sine wave with no crossings, a
  different symbol entirely. `IND_RATIO` is that ratio and the only
  number that decides it.

  Two other shapes were built and measured first, and both are recorded
  in the docstring so nobody rebuilds them. Arcs between two points on
  a line **cannot** cross their own chord: the large-arc flag takes the
  major arc, over the top, and the far side of the circle lies on the
  minor arc -- every lifted variant measured 0.00 below the leads. A row
  of whole ellipses does cross but reads as separate rings, not one
  wire.

  The span carries an extra half turn so one end dives into a loop and
  the other rises out of an arch, which is what the references show;
  `IND_PHASE` alone decides which end is which. The height is unchanged
  at 11.0, so the coil's vertical footprint and every label placed from
  it stay exactly where they were.

  **The capacitor keeps its two straight plates.** A bowed plate was
  built and drawn for a few hours and then withdrawn, on the reason
  rather than the look: a curved plate conventionally marks a
  *polarised* capacitor, and Symbulator's are not -- `c1,2,0,1'u` has no
  + end and the engine never treats one terminal differently from the
  other. It is a good-looking symbol for a different part. There is a
  test on the plates being straight, so it cannot drift back by
  accident.

  **The transformer has a symbol of its own**: two windings facing a
  core, with the polarity dots and the turns ratio. Four terminals, its
  lower pair on the rail -- not a stylistic choice, since
  `engine._stamp_t` reads both winding voltages against ground. The
  dots are not decoration either: turn counts of opposite sign mean
  opposite polarity, so the secondary's dot moves to the foot of its
  winding and the ratio is printed as magnitudes -- `t,2,3,1,-2` draws
  as `1 : 2` with the dots opposed. The reversal is said by the dots
  *or* by the sign and never by both: the engine sets
  `v(n1)/turns1 = v(n2)/turns2`, so printing the sign as well makes a
  reader apply the reversal twice and read AS7's Example 13.8 as `+2`.
  This shipped as a double count for a few hours until Roberto asked
  whether the inversion was deliberate. `-1,-2` matters as much as
  `1,-2`: two negatives are the same polarity and read like `1,2`, and
  a symbolic `1 : n` has no sign to read, so its dots stay level and it
  prints as typed. The primary
  is mirrored about its own axis so the pair face each other. Two core
  bars rather than one, because a single line at this stroke reads as a
  wire joining the windings, which is what an ideal transformer has not
  got.

  **The two-port is a block, not an element in a branch.** It was a
  labelled box in line between its two nodes, which implied a single
  series current -- and the element does not carry one: its two port
  currents differ, the difference going to ground. It is now a square
  block with a terminal at each of its four corners, the upper pair on
  the node row and the lower pair on the rail, because
  `engine._stamp_two_port` reads `v1 = v(n1)` and `v2 = v(n2)`, both
  against ground. Its four parameters are written inside it, where
  nothing else on the drawing said what a `z` or an `h` block actually
  does; a reader had to go back to the description for
  `[40,20j,30j,50]` and remember that the order is 11, 12, 21, 22.

  Its height is `ROW_H + 2*PORT_BOX_OVER`, not a literal: the lower
  terminals sit the overhang above the bottom edge, so only that value
  puts them exactly on the rail and lets the lower leads run out with
  no bend. Written as the sum, it stays bend-free if either the band or
  the overhang ever moves. The block also takes a spacer column, since
  at its full width its left face landed on the neighbouring source's
  value label.

  **One ground symbol per run of rail.** A block that grounds itself
  says so in the middle of its own gap, which is nearer to what the
  reader is looking at than the far-left end of the drawing, and the
  rail's own symbol is dropped rather than drawn twice on one line. A
  two-port gets two symbols not by exception but because it cuts the
  rail in two and each half is a run of its own. The node's name moved
  from beside the bars to under them: beside them it had to know which
  side it had room on -- a symbol set left of a block has the box hard
  against it -- and underneath there is never anything to collide with.

  335 tests and `review_schematics.py` clean over all 330 examples,
  with the exhaustive pixel sweep re-run on the final geometry.

## 0.5.25 -- 1 Sep 2026

### Added
- **A dependent source's control is drawn on the element it reads
  (#213).** A schematic that shows `4*i_r1` only in the diamond's value
  leaves the reader to work out from the netlist text *which* r1 and
  which way round -- the one thing a schematic exists to save them.

  **A voltage control marks its drop.** `ed,3,0,2*v_r1` puts a + at
  r1's first node and a - at its second, just outside the body on the
  leads, where both books put them. The direction is not a choice:
  `v_r1` is v(n1) - v(n2) (`engine.stamp_all`), so the + is at n1 every
  time, whichever way round the layout drew the element.

  **A current control marks its direction.** `ed,3,0,4*i_r1` draws an
  arrow beside r1 running first node to second, head at the second, and
  labels it *i* with `R1` as its subscript -- a sloped lower-case i, the
  way every book sets a current. Again not a choice: the solver's
  positive `i_r1` flows n1 -> n2 through the element
  (`engine._stamp_r`).

  Which element a reference names is resolved exactly as
  `engine._alias_map` resolves it, and it has to be: node voltages are
  claimed first, so in a circuit with a node called `x` the token `vx`
  is that node's voltage and *not* the drop across an element called
  `x`, and nothing is marked. Every spelling the solver folds together
  is one reference to the drawing -- `5*vr1`, `5v_R1` and `5*V_r1` all
  mark r1.

  The marks take the side the labels did not: below a horizontal
  element, left of a vertical one, and over the name when a source's
  value already hangs below its circle. 48 of the 330 example circuits
  carry them. Only the two-terminal kinds are marked; an op-amp or a
  two-port block has no single pair of terminals for a sign to sit at.

  **And the value is typeset to match.** Whatever the reader typed,
  the drawing sets multiplication as implied rather than starred
  (`2*x*ir2` is `2x` and then the current; `2*3` keeps its star, since
  `23` is a different number), a voltage or a current as its own
  lower-case sloped letter, and what it names as a capitalised
  subscript. So `2*v_r1`, `2vr1` and `2*VR1` all read *v*_R1 in the
  diamond, exactly as the resistor beside it reads R_1. A symbol the
  circuit does not define -- `vs` where there is no node or element
  `s` -- is a parameter and is left as typed, the same reading that
  keeps its source a circle. `pi` is printed as the letter for the same
  reason the star went: spelled out and run together, `100+24*pi*j`
  becomes the unreadable word `24pij`, where `24πj` reads at a
  glance.

- **The resistor is 20% smaller and the dependent source 10% larger
  (#213).** Roberto's call, 1 Sep 2026, on seeing the marks in place: a
  zigzag was crowding its neighbours and a diamond was not reading as
  the larger, more deliberate symbol it is. Both are one scale factor
  on the single number each shape is built from -- `R_SCALE` on `BODY`,
  `DEP_SCALE` on `SRC_R` -- so nothing else in the geometry needed
  re-deriving: the zigzag's vertex angle, and so its mitre, is
  unchanged because its length and its amplitude scale together. The
  two source shapes are no longer the same size as each other, so the
  callers that need to know how far a source reaches -- `_body_extent`,
  the label reach, the wire keep-out and the reference marks -- are all
  told which one they have.

### Fixed
- **An SI prefix is a decimal shift, so it is done in decimal (#217).**
  `js,0,d,397.3'm` translated to SPICE as `Is 0 d 0.39730000000000004`
  where `js,0,d,.3973` gave `Is 0 d 0.3973` — the same current, two
  spellings, one of them showing the reader a binary artefact (Roberto,
  1 Sep 2026).

  The noise was born far upstream of the netlist. `397.3'm` expanded to
  the *expression* `397.3*10**-3`, and multiplying those two out in
  binary lands one unit in the last place from the decimal that was
  typed. Nothing downstream can undo that: it is a different double,
  and `repr` is right to print all seventeen digits of it. So the
  prefix is now folded into the number in base ten, with `decimal`,
  before anything binary sees it — for the quoted form (`397.3'm`) and
  the bare suffix (`397.3m`) alike, and for every prefix.

  **A whole-numbered mantissa still keeps the `n*10**e` form**, which
  SymPy reads as an exact Rational: `100'p` is 1/10000000000, not a
  float, and a circuit of whole-numbered values still solves exactly.
  Only a mantissa that already carries a decimal point — a Float
  either way — is folded.

  The same bug ran in the other direction, in the two number
  formatters: `2.2e-9 / 10**-9` is 2.1999999999999997 in binary, and
  that went out as `2.1999999999999997N`. Both now take the mantissa
  out in base ten and check it by reading the decimal back, not by
  multiplying floats. `100'p` gains from it too — it used to come back
  as `100.00000000000001P` and is now `100P`.

  Measured rather than assumed: of the 330 example circuits, seven use
  a decimal mantissa with a prefix (the only ones whose stored value
  can move at all), and all seven print byte-identical answers before
  and after. The stored double moves toward the value the reader
  typed; nothing the reader sees moves.

- **The stacked-row height was never measured (#213).** A lifted
  source hangs its value below its circle and the element on the row
  beneath stacks a value and a name above its own; that is 34.75px
  down against 45.35px up, so `STACK_H` needed 84 and had 78. The pair
  had been overlapping by 0.4px since #212 gave every name a
  subscript -- under the review harness's 2px tolerance, and so
  invisible until the values gained subscripts too and it grew to 2.1.
  Now 88.

## 0.5.24 -- 31 Aug 2026

### Changed
- **The schematics are drawn the way a textbook draws them (#212).**
  Roberto's brief, worked against Sadiku & Alexander's *Fundamentals of
  Electric Circuits* and Boylestad's *Introductory Circuit Analysis*.

  **Element names carry a subscript.** `rin` draws as R with a
  capitalised subscript IN, `r1` as R with a subscript 1 -- the kind
  letter full height, the rest below it, the way both books set them.
  One `<text>` per label with a `<tspan>` per run, the subscript shifted
  relative to the run before it so a caption can come back up to full
  size after `R1 = `. An underscore is a separator rather than a
  character to print (`r_a` is R sub A), which makes the *display*
  many-to-one -- `rab`, `rAB` and `r_a_b` all read alike. That is
  confined to the drawing: answers, exports and the description keep
  every name exactly as it was typed.

  **The inductor is a coil of loops.** Each turn is now an arc of more
  than a semicircle across a chord shorter than its own diameter, so it
  closes back past where it started and the turns overlap -- a written
  cursive `l`, repeated. It was four exact semicircles over chords of
  exactly 2r, which is a row of humps.

  **A controlled source is a diamond**, an independent one stays a
  circle (Sadiku, Fig. 1.13). A source counts as controlled when its
  value refers to another quantity in the circuit, tested against the
  circuit's own names and folded the way the SPICE exporter folds them,
  since `i_r1`, `ir1` and `IR1` have been one name to the solver since
  0.5.19.

  **Labels clear the symbols.** Placement now comes from each symbol's
  ink rather than one offset for every kind -- the old fixed offset
  cleared a resistor's zigzag and ran through a capacitor's plates.
  `REACH` is an ink figure, half a stroke outside its path and, for the
  resistor, 2.2px further still, because a mitred peak runs past its
  own vertex. That last figure came from measuring rendered pixels:
  labels the path geometry called 3px clear were 1px clear on screen.

  Also: the zigzag's peaks are mitred rather than taking the drawing's
  global round join, which was turning each peak into a blob.

  The label font's ink extents are measured rather than assumed
  (`LABEL_ASCENT`, `LABEL_DESCENT`, `CAP_DESCENT`), because a baseline
  is not an edge: a value like `-4j` or `1/gx`, or a node named `ag`,
  hangs below its baseline, and placement that ignored that left 21 of
  the 330 example circuits with 1-2px of air above a symbol.

  No API changed. `to_svg()` takes the same descriptions and returns
  the same kind of standalone SVG.

## 0.5.23 -- 31 Aug 2026

### Changed
- **The engine speaks in codes (#199).** Every `CircuitError` the
  package raises now carries a **message code and its arguments** as
  well as its English: `exc.code`, `exc.args_map`, and `str(exc)`
  rendering from the new `symbulator/messages.py`. Roberto's ruling of
  31 Aug 2026 -- the package is meant to be under the hood, so it
  should return structure and let the interface do the words. Thirty-six
  codes, numbered by module: 2xx `elements`, 3xx `engine`, 4xx
  `laplace`, 5xx `equiv`, 6xx `spice`.

  Three rules go with them. **A code is permanent once published** --
  never reused, never renumbered, gaps left alone. **Severity is a
  field, not a range**, so a warning and an error about one thing need
  one code. And **the English stays in the package**: it is what a
  traceback, a bug report or the `.txt` export can quote, and it is the
  generation source for the app's translations, which is the drift this
  scheme exists to prevent.

- **`CircuitError` still takes a plain string**, and that is not a
  transition shim. `CircuitError("some sentence")` sets `code` to None
  and behaves exactly as before, which is how an exception re-raised
  from elsewhere keeps flowing through -- and what let the app and the
  package deploy in either order rather than in step.

- Four messages became two codes apiece rather than one code with a
  glued-on clause, because the clause is prose a translator has to see
  whole: the two `_diagnose_unsolvable` diagnoses with and without
  their dc parenthetical, and "could not solve" with and without the
  extra-equation hint.

- `laplace._check_transform` takes `fn` (a function's name, or None for
  the `{...}` shorthand) where it used to take `origin`, a ready-made
  English phrase. A phrase cannot be translated from inside an
  argument; a function's name is the same in every language.

### Not in this release
- **`spice.py`'s warnings are #211.** They look like seventeen messages
  and are not: seven are `f"{el.name}: {why}"` with `why` built
  elsewhere, `skip()` alone has seven reasons, and the `described` map
  names eleven element kinds. That is thirty-odd more codes, and the
  SPICE translator is still labelled beta in the app -- its wording is
  the likeliest in the package to change, and a code is permanent.

## 0.5.22 -- 29 Aug 2026

### Changed
- **Brackets mean pr only in a resistor's value (#165).** `[...]` is
  the parallel-resistor shorthand (in an `r` element's value) or a
  two-port's parameter term; anywhere else it used to be silently
  passed to `pr()` -- `e1,1,0,[4,4]` became a meaningless "2 V"
  source, and on a capacitor it would have computed the *series*
  combination -- and now stops with a message naming both legitimate
  uses. Restores the calculator's scope, per Roberto. A `pr(...)`
  the user types remains a function call, allowed anywhere; nested
  brackets in a resistor value still work.

- The README documents the case rule (names fold, `2*VR1` is
  `2*v_r1`; free variables are case-sensitive, `c` is not `C`) and
  the two-port parameter term; llms.txt carries both among its
  easy-to-get-wrong notes.

## 0.5.21 -- 29 Aug 2026

### Added
- **Two-port parameters in the description (#163).** A two-port
  element takes an optional last term listing its four parameters:
  `z,1,2,[100,10,20,50]`. Entries are numbers, SI-prefixed values or
  expressions; each binds its correspondingly-named variable
  (`z11`...) through the same substitution machinery as
  `conditions=`, so the values are visible to expert equations and
  ride into solved answers -- the calculator's "store the values in
  the variables first", made part of the circuit text. Without the
  term the parameters stay free symbols (the tacit
  `[<name>11,...,<name>22]`), exactly as before; an explicit
  condition on the same name overrides the term; the `params=` dict
  still works. There is no clash with the `[a,b]` parallel shorthand:
  two-port elements have no value field where a parallel combination
  could appear, and the internal `pr(...)` encoding disambiguates by
  element kind. The app's Define field now reaches two-port
  parameters too (`symbulator_ui.expand_defines_in_desc` materialises
  the tacit term when a define names one of its entries).

- **Every element type now exports to SPICE (#162).** The ideal
  op-amp becomes a gain-1e9 VCVS (the universal SPICE idiom;
  parts-per-billion finite-gain error, and the warning says so). The
  ideal transformer becomes its *exact* realization -- a VCVS at the
  turns ratio, a 0 V current sense, and a CCCS reflecting the
  secondary current into the primary -- correct at DC, unlike the
  coupled-inductor approximation. A two-port block with a numeric
  parameter term becomes up to four grounded VCCS elements via the
  engine's own admittance reduction, transcribed verbatim so exporter
  and solver cannot disagree; parameter sets singular in admittance
  form warn. All verified against the independent simulator per node
  voltage, alongside the #161 cases.

### Fixed
- Numbers computed by the SPICE exporter (admittance coefficients,
  turns ratios, coupling factors) are now written with round-trip
  precision instead of 6 significant digits, which shifted solved
  voltages at the 1e-6 level. Values a person typed keep their short
  spelling.
- **Dependent sources now translate to SPICE (#161).** `to_spice()`
  reads a dependent source's value as an affine expression over node
  voltages (`v_2`), two-terminal element drops (`v_r1`) and element
  currents (`i_r1`) -- spelling equivalence included -- and emits one
  plain linear SPICE element per term: E/G for a voltage control
  (`+k`/`-k` node pairs fold into one textbook difference-controlled
  element), H/F for a current control, an independent V/I for a
  constant; terms chain in series for a voltage source and in
  parallel for a current source. A current control on anything that
  is not already a voltage source gets a 0 V sensing source spliced
  into that element's branch -- SPICE's own ammeter idiom -- shared
  across referencing sources, and working for chains of dependent
  sources sensing each other. The current of an independent current
  source is its value, so it folds into the constant instead. No
  behavioral or dialect-specific elements are ever emitted. Values
  that are not affine with numeric coefficients (nonlinear controls,
  symbolic gains) warn exactly as before, and a reference to a
  current that cannot translate poisons the referencing source with
  a warning naming the culprit, cascading as far as it reaches.

  Verified two independent ways: round trips through `from_spice()`
  re-solved and compared, and -- because a symmetric sign flip would
  cancel in a round trip -- every emitted netlist also runs through
  `ahkab`, an independently implemented MNA simulator, node voltage
  by node voltage (`test_spice_groundtruth.py`, self-skipping where
  ahkab is unavailable). That harness caught and documented ahkab's
  own quirk: its H senses with the opposite sign to its own F and to
  the ngspice manual, which ngspice, LTspice and PSpice follow and
  this exporter targets.

## 0.5.20 -- 29 Aug 2026

### Added
- **SPICE netlist translation, both directions (#160).**
  `to_spice(desc)` writes a Symbulator circuit description as a
  generic ngspice-compatible netlist; `from_spice(text)` reads the
  linear subset of one back. Both return `(text, warnings)`: an
  element or value the destination cannot express is never
  mistranslated -- it is kept as a `*` comment on export, dropped on
  import, and named in the warnings either way. r/l/c (with initial
  conditions as `IC=`), independent sources, the short circuit (a 0 V
  source, SPICE's own idiom), mutual inductance (K, computed from
  numeric inductances) and SPICE's E/G/F/H controlled sources all
  translate; op-amps, ideal transformers, two-port blocks, symbolic
  values, waveform sources and everything nonlinear warn instead.
  The mega/milli trap is handled by construction: `1'M` exports as
  `1MEG`, `1MEG`/`1M` import as `1'M`/`1'm`, and the exporter never
  writes a bare `M` at all (milli becomes a plain decimal). Feeds
  the app's SPICE Translator card.

- **Element names must be identifier-safe (#159).** A name like
  `r-x` used to parse, but referencing its current -- `2*i_r-x` --
  silently read as `2*i_r - x` and solved to an answer full of
  phantom symbols. `parse_circuit` now refuses such names with a
  message saying why. The never-enforced `RESERVED_NAMES` set is
  deleted; there are no reserved names.

### Fixed
- Stale `positive=True` wording in `Result.at()`'s docstring and the
  package docstring: the time symbol has been
  `Symbol("t", nonnegative=True)` since 0.5.11.

## 0.5.19 -- 28 Aug 2026

### Added
- **Inequality conditions -- the `|` operator's full breadth.** On the
  calculators, `solve(...) | vs>0` restricted which solutions came
  back; the port had narrowed conditions to `name = value`
  substitutions only. An expert-mode condition may now also be an
  inequality (`vs > 0`, `x <= 3`), applied as a filter on the
  solutions after the solve -- the natural way to select among the
  sign-symmetric roots a quadratic power constraint produces, in the
  same call. A restriction that excludes every solution is reported
  as such: the system solves, but the mathematics and the restriction
  disagree, which is an answer rather than a failure. Equality
  conditions substitute exactly as before, and the two kinds mix.
  Roberto's call, solving his 2013 four-dependent-source showcase for
  the monograph.

- **Python keywords work as variable names.** `is` -- the most
  natural name a source current can have -- was refused: values parse
  through Python's own grammar, and its reserved words leaked through
  to the circuits user. Keywords used as bare names are now shielded
  behind sentinel identifiers before parsing and restored as ordinary
  symbols after, so `j1,0,1,is` and `unknowns=['is']` work
  everywhere a name can appear. `True`/`False`/`None` stay excluded:
  those are literals, and refusing them beats quietly turning them
  into symbols.

- **Underscored and plain spellings are one name, everywhere.** On the
  TI calculators every answer variable was one flat word -- `ir1`,
  `vc2`, `is` -- and version 9's `i_r1` convention split each of them
  in two. The split is now healed: every circuit builds an alias map
  from its own inventory (nodes and elements), and any spelling that
  normalises to a known answer name -- case-insensitive, underscores
  ignored -- is canonicalised to it wherever expressions are read:
  element values (`j2,0,3,0.5*ir1` controls on the current through
  r1), expert equations, unknowns, and both kinds of condition. A
  1999-era netlist now runs verbatim. Names that match nothing in the
  circuit are left untouched, so free symbols still pass through; the
  one behavioural change is that a bare spelling which happens to
  collide with a real answer name now means that answer, as it always
  did on the calculator. Roberto's design call: "if there is a i_s,
  there is also an is."

## 0.5.18 -- 28 Aug 2026

### Changed
- **The schematic op-amp's + and - pin signs match the voltage
  source's polarity marks (#130).** They were 13px text glyphs, filled
  from the label font, sitting beside a source whose marks are stroked
  3.5px arms at the page's 1.7px stroke -- visibly heavier and a
  different drawing style in the same figure. Both now draw through
  one helper (`_sign_mark`), so they are identical in size and weight
  and cannot fall out of step again.

## 0.5.17 -- 28 Aug 2026

### Changed
- **A schematic op-amp's feedback wire leaves the tip the way the
  triangle points.** 0.5.16's follower loop rose vertically out of the
  tip vertex, which read wrong -- an op-amp's output exits in the
  direction the symbol points. The loop now runs 16px out of the tip
  before turning up, in both the corner-join and the occupied-row
  paths; the join at the output node's own corner is unchanged.
  Roberto's call, reviewing Bo2's Figure 6.23.

## 0.5.16 -- 28 Aug 2026

### Changed
- **The schematic drawer was reviewed against all 322 circuits in the
  version 9 tutorial and reworked.** The headline rules: a wire never
  crosses an element body; a crossing that is not a connection is
  drawn as the standard semicircular hop, and every T-joint gets its
  junction dot, so the two can never be confused; junctions coincide
  with node corners wherever the row allows; and values are shown the
  way the reader typed them.

  In detail, labels first: a phasor source keeps its angle notation
  (`110∠-120°`) instead of the 17-digit rectangular number it expands
  to; long float literals round to 5 significant digits; `30*pi/180`
  in a value reads back as `30°`; the `[a,b]` parallel shortcut is
  restored from its `pr(a,b)` rewrite; a value too long to letter at
  its element moves to a caption line below the drawing (`name =
  value`, the block the mutual inductances already used -- their
  captions move down there too); the viewBox accounts for text width,
  so nothing is clipped; and a source's value sits clear of its
  circle.

  Layout second, mostly op-amps: cascades draw left to right (the
  node walk follows the inverting-input-to-output link, defers an
  output node until its input is placed, and links n+ toward n-);
  grounded elements hanging on a column an op-amp occupies bump to a
  stub column outside its span; a non-inverting stage whose + input
  connects only to a grounded source draws that source in the input
  drop, under the triangle, the way a textbook does; an op-amp whose
  *inverting* input is ground mirrors its pins; the follower written
  `o1,1,2,2` springs its feedback straight up from the tip corner and
  joins the output node at the node's own corner dot; and stacked
  spans order narrow-below-wide so an outer element's risers land on
  junctions instead of slicing through an inner element's body.

## 0.5.15 -- 27 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **An impulse-valued TR answer now says so.** `tr()` passed every
  s-free s-domain value through untransformed, so a circuit answer that
  was genuinely an impulse printed as a bare constant --
  `e,1,0,10*delta(t)` into a resistor reported `v_1 = 10`, identical to
  a 10 V step. But a circuit answer constant in s *is* an impulse: a
  step arrives as `k/s` and a waveform brings its own s, so a bare
  constant has nowhere else to come from. Those answers now come back
  multiplied by `DiracDelta(t)`: `v_1 = 10*DiracDelta(t)`.

  The pass-through was protecting two real cases, and both still pass
  through -- discriminated by provenance now, not by the expression's
  shape. A solved expert-mode unknown is a scalar (`k = 5` means the
  amplitude is 5), recognised by its key; a dependent source's echo of
  its controlling answer (`i_j = 2*ir3`) is a relation whose symbols
  name functions, so it reads identically in s and in t, recognised by
  `_is_controlled`. Zero answers are unaffected either way --
  `0*DiracDelta(t)` is 0.

  Found on 27 Aug 2026 while wiring TR answers into the app's
  Numerical Solver handover; every impulse example in the tutorial
  prints only s-bearing answers (`vc`, `ic`, `vo`), which is how the
  wrong constants went unnoticed. Answers mixing an impulse with a
  tail (`DiracDelta(t) - exp(-t)`) were already right.

## 0.5.14 -- 27 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **An error about a value now quotes what was typed, not the machine's
  rewrite of it (#59).** Values are rewritten before they are parsed:
  `[a,b]` becomes `pr(a,b)` and `1'k` becomes `1*10**3`. The complaint
  came from after that, so typing `[1'k,2'k` was answered with

      Could not read the value 'pr(1*10**3,2*10**3': '(' was never closed.

  which is the machine's business and not the reader's. `safe_sympify` and
  `check_expression_syntax` now take the original text alongside the
  rewritten one and quote the original; `Element` keeps the fields as they
  were typed, so the engine can recover them.

  An unbalanced bracket is caught before the rewrite instead, because it
  cannot be recovered afterwards -- the typed text and the rewrite split
  into different numbers of fields, so the two can no longer be lined up:

      'r1,1,0,[1'k,2'k' is missing a closing bracket. A parallel
      combination is written [a,b], as in [1'k,2'k].

- **A name used as a function says so.** `rx[1'k]` has balanced brackets,
  so it rewrites into something shaped like a call, passes the syntax gate
  -- which legitimately allows calls -- and died inside SymPy as
  `'Symbol' object is not callable`, naming neither the value nor the
  circuit. It now names the value. It deliberately does *not* name the
  symbol in that case: the rewrite makes `rx[1'k]` into `rxpr(...)`, and
  the culprit SymPy reports is a name the reader never typed.

- **An unrecognised unit prefix names the value** and lists the prefixes
  that exist, instead of "Circuit description uses shorthand that
  Symbulator does not recognize" with nothing to go on.

None of these was ever mis-solved -- every case was refused, and the
syntax gate is untouched, so this is not a security change.

## 0.5.13 -- 27 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **`th()` no longer throws away the half of the answer it found.** The
  tool runs two solves: the circuit as given, for the open-circuit
  voltage, and the circuit with a short across the terminals, for the
  Norton current. The second was allowed to take the first down with it,
  so a circuit whose short-circuit round has no solution returned
  nothing at all -- where the calculator versions left you holding the
  Thevenin voltage.

  An ideal op-amp output is the case that found this. Shorting it asks
  what current flows when a fixed voltage sits across zero resistance,
  and the system has no solution. But the question does have an answer,
  and it is the one the documentation asserts without ever showing: the
  current is unbounded, so the equivalent impedance is zero.

  So the short is now measured rather than assumed. When it will not
  solve, the terminals get a resistance `x_test` instead of a short and
  the current's limit is taken as `x_test` goes to zero -- which is what
  a short is. An unbounded limit means `ino` is infinite and `z` is 0,
  reported as a result rather than guessed at. A finite one means the
  short was merely awkward to solve and the answer was there all along.
  Either way `TheveninResult.note` says which happened; it is empty on
  an ordinary run, and ordinary runs are untouched.

  Only if the limit cannot settle it either does the call still fail --
  and the message now carries the open-circuit voltage, so the half that
  was found is not lost.

### Added
- `TheveninResult.note`, a sentence explaining how the short-circuit
  round was resolved when it was not simply solved. Empty otherwise.

## 0.5.12 -- 26 Aug 2026

### Added
- **Expert mode works with the equivalent tools.** `th()`, `er()` and
  `port()` now accept `equations`, `unknowns` and `conditions` and pass
  them to every solve they run. The original barred expert mode from
  these tools, but nothing in the physics required it: an equivalent is
  orchestration over the same solver, and the arguments simply were not
  being handed on.

  This is what lets a dependent source be defined against a derived
  name -- `vx` with `vx = va - vb` as an added equation and `vx` as an
  added unknown -- while asking for a Thevenin equivalent, which
  previously had to be written by substituting the difference into the
  source's value by hand.

  `th()` runs two rounds, an open-circuit solve and a short-circuit one,
  and the extras go into both. That is right for a condition on a
  parameter and for an equation naming a derived quantity, which mean
  the same thing in either round. It is not right for an equation that
  pins an unknown element value from a measurement: that measurement
  holds in the circuit as given, not in the shorted copy, so the two
  rounds are asking for different things. In practice the short-circuit
  round then has no consistent solution and the solve raises, which is
  the outcome you want -- but it is a consequence rather than a guard,
  so determine such a value with a plain solve first and put the number
  in the description. Documented on `th()` rather than guarded, since
  telling the two kinds of extra apart means guessing at intent.


## 0.5.11 -- 26 Aug 2026

### Changed
- **Every domain-sensitive input is read in the same domain as its
  analysis's answers.** FD reads in s, TR reads in t. Source values
  already did; added equations, added conditions, Evaluate expressions
  and the Solve card now do too.

  This completes a design choice made in version 8, not a new one. The
  calculator settled the awkward case by removing TR from expert mode
  altogether -- its prompt offers "1:DC 2:AC 3:FD" -- so there was no
  precedent to match, only a gap to close.

  A relation between plain parameters, `x = 3`, is left alone: it fixes a
  symbol in the circuit rather than describing a signal, and dividing it
  by s would turn a 3 V source into a ramp.

- **`{...}` works wherever the convention it escapes is enforced**, not
  only in the circuit description, and it is evaluated where it is
  written rather than rewritten to `t2s(...)`. That is what lets a
  failure name the brackets the reader typed instead of a function they
  never wrote.

### Fixed
- **The time symbol is non-negative, so impulses survive.** SymPy
  evaluates DiracDelta of a strictly positive argument to 0, so under the
  old symbol every impulse silently vanished: a `delta(t)` source, the
  scalar an expert-mode unknown solves to in TR, and `s2t(1)`, which
  answered 0 where the answer is `DiracDelta(t)`. t >= 0 is also what the
  one-sided transform is defined on, and the origin is where an impulse
  lives.

  `positive` had been chosen for tidy answers, since it lets the
  transforms drop `Heaviside(t)`. That is folded away afterwards instead,
  matching `Heaviside(t)` and nothing else -- `Heaviside(t - 1)` is a step
  delayed to t = 1 and genuinely zero before then. Every documented answer
  is unchanged.

  It also removed the reason the parser bound a separate neutral `t`, so
  `v_2 + t` in Evaluate no longer carries two identical-looking symbols
  that never combine.

- **Both ends of both transforms are checked, and a mismatch stops.**
  `t2s(x)` wants x valid in t and must produce s; `s2t(x)` the reverse.
  "Valid in t" means "does not mention s", not "mentions t" -- a constant
  is valid in either, and `{5}` meaning a step of 5 keeps working.

  The input check catches `s2t(exp(-t))`, which returned 0 with nothing
  to show anything was wrong. The output check catches `t2s(1/t)`, which
  passes the input check and comes back as an unevaluated
  LaplaceTransform.

- **`t2s` and `s2t` read strings properly.** Their docstrings advertise
  `t2s("5")`, but they used bare `sp.sympify`, so anything past a plain
  number was wrong: `"5*u(t)"` made an undefined function of u, `"2'k"`
  would not parse, and `"1-e^(-t/2)"` read the caret as XOR and e as a
  symbol. Those failures were silent, arriving as unevaluated transforms.

## 0.5.10 -- 26 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **Expert mode in TR no longer answers zero.** An extra unknown solved
  for in a transient analysis -- the amplitude of a source, most often --
  came back as 0 with no error and no warning.

  `tr()` runs `fd()` and inverse-Laplace-transforms what it solved. Every
  node voltage and element current is a function of s and wants
  transforming. An expert-mode unknown is a plain number and does not:
  `inverse_laplace_transform(1, s, t)` is `DiracDelta(t)`, the time
  symbol is declared positive, and DiracDelta of a positive-only symbol
  evaluates to 0. So a step height the s-domain solve had correctly found
  to be 1 was reported as 0.

  Values with no `s` in them now pass through untransformed. AS2's
  step-source problem in the transient lesson -- find the amplitude given
  v_c(t) -- returns the book's 1 V again, and `fd` and `tr` agree on it.

  This is the third bug caused by DiracDelta collapsing under a positive
  t. It read as "expert mode does not work in TR" rather than as a
  transform problem, because what it ate was a scalar rather than a
  waveform.

## 0.5.9 -- 25 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **A dependent source that reads a capacitor's current, or any element's
  voltage, is now actually connected to it.** Both were being left as free
  symbols that no equation constrained.

  Most references already worked: an element's *current* is normally one of
  the unknowns, so `2*i_r1` on a source resolves by itself. Two quantities
  are not unknowns. A capacitor's current is stamped straight into `known`
  as an expression in the node voltages, and an element's *voltage* is
  derived as v(n1) - v(n2) only when the answers are reported. Naming
  either from a source value produced a symbol with nothing behind it.

  What made this hard to see is that it did not look like a failure.
  sympy solved the system it was given and answered every quantity *in
  terms of* the loose symbol, so AS7's Example 10.1 came back as
  `i_cx = i_cx*(0.9655 + 0.4138j) + 2.897 + 1.241j` -- a closed-form
  equation, printed where a number belonged, in a circuit that reported
  itself solved. It now gives 7.59 angle 108.4 degrees, which is the
  answer in print.

  AS7's Practice Problem 10.1 (voltage-controlled) and Example 10.13
  (controlled by a capacitor current in a chain) are fixed by the same
  change and are now regression tests, along with Example 10.1.

  Example 10.14 also solves about twice as fast, because the free symbol
  had been enlarging the system it was carried through.

## 0.5.8 -- 25 Aug 2026

### Added
- **Polar phasors, written with the angle sign.** `(20∠ 30°)` is how
  every circuits textbook writes a phasor and how versions 7 and 8 accept
  one; it now works here too. Both degree characters are taken -- the real
  degree sign and the masculine ordinal, which looks identical and appears
  20 times in the 2023 documentation -- and a negative angle written with
  an en dash is read rather than refused.

  **It becomes a rectangular number, not `20*exp(I*pi/6)`**, and that is
  the point rather than a detail. SymPy cannot reduce
  `exp(I*pi*130/180)` to a closed form, so an exponential source is
  carried unevaluated through every mesh equation of the circuit. AS7's
  Example 12.12 written that way was killed by the web app's 25-second
  limit and did not converge in several minutes offline; with the angle
  sign it solves in under three, and matches the answer in print. Its
  Example 12.3 went from 94 seconds to two.

  Where an angle happens to simplify -- 120 degrees, say -- the
  exponential form was always fast, which is what made this look like a
  property of particular circuits rather than of the notation.

  Exactness is given up deliberately: `100∠ 0°` is 100.0, not 100.
  A phasor angle is a measurement, and the alternative is circuits that do
  not solve.

## 0.5.7 -- 25 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **Mutual inductance between impedances given in jOhms.** A textbook
  writes a coupled pair one of two ways: two inductors in henries, or two
  impedances already in jOhms. The port stamped only the first. The second
  -- `r` elements with imaginary values, coupled by an `m` whose value is
  imaginary too -- was accepted, solved, and answered with **no current at
  all in the secondary**. No error, no warning, just a zero where the
  answer should be.

  `symbv8s8` couples `r` elements when the analysis is AC, adding the
  mutual term without a jw factor because a value in jOhms is already an
  impedance:

      v(n1) - v(n2) = Z*i_self + sum(M * i_other)

  Restored exactly. Checked against the two worked examples in the
  Symbulator 7 and 8 documentation, whose answers Roberto derived by hand:
  AS7's Example 13.1 gives 13.02 at -49.4 degrees and 2.910 at 14.04, and
  its Practice Problem 13.1 gives 20.00 at -134.43. All three match.

## 0.5.6 -- 25 Aug 2026

### Added
- **The `{...}` shorthand for a time-domain source in FD.** FD reads its
  source values in the s-domain -- `5/s` is a step, `5` is an impulse.
  Wrapping a value in braces says "this one is written in time", and it is
  transformed on the way in. `{5}`, `{u(t)}` and `{2*exp(-4*t)}` all work,
  and `{5}` is exactly `t2s(5)` in five fewer characters.

  Ported from `symbv8si`, which does the same two substitutions and only
  when the tool is fd -- TR converts its sources anyway, so there would be
  nothing for it to do there. Asking for it elsewhere now says so instead
  of letting the braces reach SymPy and come back as "contains a set".

  Not to be confused with `[...]`, which is the parallel-impedance
  shortcut (`[2,3]` is `pr(2,3)`), applies in every analysis, and has
  worked since the port. The two are pinned against each other by a test.

## 0.5.5 -- 25 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **`tr()` reads its sources in the time domain again.** The original
  transforms a transient source into the s-domain on the way in and
  transforms the answers back on the way out. This port only ever did the
  second half, so every transient result was one integration short: a
  plain `12` gave the impulse response where the step response was meant,
  and it looked plausible enough to pass a glance.

  The rule restored here is `symbv8s5`'s, read out of the Symbulator 8
  document rather than inferred:

      If tool="tr" and the element is a source (e or j):
        value depends on t          -> t2s(value)
        value is a constant         -> value/s   (a step of that size)
        value refers to another
          element's answer          -> left alone

  That last branch matters: a controlled source's value is a relation, not
  a waveform, and transforming `2*i_r1` would be meaningless. A value
  already written in terms of `s` is also left alone, so every existing
  version 9 description keeps working -- all twelve of the app's bundled
  examples answer exactly as they did in 0.5.4.

- **`delta(t)` no longer vanishes.** 0.5.3 bound `t` in the parsing
  namespace to the solver's `Symbol("t", positive=True)`. That changes
  what an expression *means* rather than only which symbol it uses: SymPy
  evaluates `DiracDelta` of a strictly positive argument to zero, so an
  impulse source was gone before the transform ever saw it. `t` parses as
  a neutral symbol again, and `t2s()` now takes the time symbol from the
  expression it is given instead of assuming one -- forcing a symbol the
  expression does not contain made `laplace_transform` treat the whole
  thing as a constant, which is how `t` came back as `t/s` instead of
  `1/s**2`.

## 0.5.4 -- 24 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **A digit inside a name is no longer read as a multiplication.** The
  implicit-multiplication rule added in 0.5.1 looked only at the character
  before the letter, so any name with a digit in the middle was split:
  `t2s(t)` became `t2*s(t)`, and the function vanished into a symbol called
  `t2` times a symbol called `s`. That broke `t2s` and `s2t` -- the two
  functions 0.5.3 had just made reachable, and the two most likely to be
  typed into a transient source. `i2r`, `v2` and any other name of that
  shape were affected the same way.

  A number now has to start where a name could not: `2ir3` and `.2v1` still
  gain their multiplication, `t2s(t)` and `i2r` are left alone.

## 0.5.3 -- 24 Aug 2026

### Added
- **`t2s()` and `s2t()` can be reached from a circuit.** Both have existed
  since the port and are exported, but a value, an Evaluate expression or a
  Solve equation is parsed against a deliberately small namespace, and
  neither was in it -- so `t2s(5)` was read as a variable being called and
  failed with "'Symbol' object is not callable". They are now available
  wherever an expression is, so a source can be written `t2s(5)` rather
  than hand-transformed to `5/s`.

- **`t` and `s` resolve to the symbols the solver itself uses.** This is
  the part that would have bitten quietly: `tr()` writes its answers in
  `Symbol("t", positive=True)`, and a hand-written `t` used to become a
  bare `Symbol("t")` -- a different symbol, which `subs()` ignores without
  complaint and which `t2s()` would integrate over instead of the real
  time variable.

`pf()` is deliberately not included. It returns a sentence -- "pf: 0.6
lagging" -- rather than an expression, so sympify hands back a Python str
and every formatter downstream expects a SymPy object. It belongs in the
interface as a tool with its own inputs and a text result, not as
something callable in a value.

## 0.5.2 -- 24 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **The calculator's notation is kept, not replaced.** 0.5.1 expanded the
  new shorthands everywhere, including on the path that echoes a circuit
  back to the caller. The web app puts that echo straight into its Circuit
  Description box, so typing `V*u(t)` and pressing Run silently rewrote it
  to `V*Heaviside(t)` -- taking away the notation the user had deliberately
  chosen, on their first attempt, and leaving their circuit no longer
  matching the book they copied it from.

  The expansion now happens only on the way to being solved. Echoed back,
  `u(t)`, the Greek delta, `2ir3` and `2e^(-4t)` all survive exactly as
  typed. This puts them in the same category as the `'k` prefix, which has
  always been parsed and kept, rather than with the AC imaginary unit,
  which is deliberately normalised in view of the user because `J` and `j`
  meaning the same thing is worth making explicit.

  The `[...]` shortcut still expands unconditionally: `_split_fields`
  cannot tell its inner commas from an element's own field commas without
  it.

## 0.5.1 -- 24 Aug 2026

### Added
- **The calculator's syntax is read as written.** A circuit description
  copied out of the Symbulator 7 or 8 documentation used to fail in this
  package, which meant the version 9 documentation had to carry a second
  spelling of every circuit. Four habits are now understood, and each one
  was chosen so that nothing is taken away from anyone who was not using
  it:

  - `u(t)` is the unit step and the Greek delta is the impulse, becoming
    `Heaviside(t)` and `DiracDelta(t)`. `u` is also the micro prefix, and
    the two are told apart by whether a `(` follows: `7u` is micro, `7u(t)`
    is the step. A bare `u` is therefore untouched and still works as an
    ordinary variable -- unlike the names in the parsing namespace, which
    are taken from every user. ASCII `delta(t)` is accepted too, for
    keyboards without the character.

  - `^` is exponentiation. It was not merely unsupported before: `2^3` was
    rejected outright, because a caret is XOR in Python and the expression
    guard refuses it. It now reads as 8.

  - `e^x` is Euler's number raised to x, becoming `exp(x)`. Only a caret
    makes `e` special, so `e` on its own remains an ordinary variable and a
    source valued `e` still solves.

  - Multiplication may be implied: `2ir3`, `.2v1`, `2(a+b)`, `(a)(b)` and
    `10e^(-t)sin(2t)` all read as products.

  Two things are deliberately protected from that last rule. Scientific
  notation stays a number -- without the guard `2.5e3` becomes `2.5*e3`,
  quietly replacing a value with a symbol -- and so does a bare engineering
  suffix, since `1k` is a thousand rather than one times k. The difference
  is whether the letter is an SI prefix: `2m` is milli, `2t` is a product.

## 0.5.0 -- 23 Aug 2026

### Added
- **`to_svg()` and `draw()`: a circuit description can now be drawn, not
  only solved.** `symbulator.schematic` renders the same string `dc()`,
  `ac()`, `fd()` and `tr()` already take into a standalone SVG, using only
  the standard library -- no matplotlib, no LaTeX, no external toolchain --
  so it runs unchanged in CPython and under Pyodide in the browser builds.
  Every stroke is `currentColor`, so one drawing serves a light and a dark
  page without being redrawn.

  The layout is deliberately not a general graph-drawing algorithm.
  Force-directed placement, which most netlist viewers reach for, produces
  a physics-plausible blob rather than something that reads as a schematic.
  This assumes instead the shape nearly every linear teaching circuit
  already has: ground as one rail along the bottom, anything touching it
  hanging vertically from it, anything between two live nodes running
  along a top row, and node order taken from a depth-first walk so a chain
  comes out as a chain. Anything that would collide -- a parallel element,
  or one reaching over an intermediate node -- is lifted onto its own row
  with risers, which is interval-graph colouring over the span each
  element occupies. Op-amps use the same colouring, with the colours
  becoming lanes down the middle band.

  Two details are taken from the engine rather than chosen, and must not
  be "corrected" without reading it: a voltage source's **+** goes on `n1`,
  because `_stamp_e` stamps `v(n1) - v(n2) = value`; and a coupled
  inductor's dot goes on `n1` of **every** coupled inductor, always,
  because the coupling enters as `+M*i_other` with no orientation term --
  reversed coupling is expressed as a *negative* M, so the dots never
  move and the sign appears in the caption instead. Mutual inductance is
  captioned rather than drawn, since `m` couples two elements rather than
  two nodes and a dashed tie between coils just reads as another wire.

  `to_svg` parses with `expand_si=False`, so a bare `1k` draws where the
  solver would stop and ask which it meant. A circuit can therefore be
  drawn before, or without, being solved -- which is when a picture helps
  most.

  Known limits, documented in the module: a bridge draws as a ladder with
  a jumper rather than the textbook diamond; an inductor coupled to two
  others with opposite signs cannot be drawn faithfully, the dot
  convention having no notation for it; a non-grounded op-amp `+` input is
  routed but may cross wires; and two-port blocks and the transformer draw
  as labelled boxes without their port parameters.

## 0.4.6 -- 22 Aug 2026

### Added
- **Every root of a circuit is now returned, not just the first.** An
  expert-mode equation written on a power is quadratic in its unknown, so a
  circuit like `e,1,0,e` / `r1,1,0,1'k` with `p_r1 = 0.025` is solved by
  `e = 5` *and* `e = -5`; both satisfy every constraint given. `solve_circuit`
  kept whichever SymPy happened to list first, which was the negative one, and
  presented it as the answer. `solve_circuit_all()` now returns them all, and
  `Result.solutions` exposes the list (`[values]` when there is only one, so
  the shape never varies), with `Result.multiple` as the flag and a `repr`
  banner naming the count. `solve_circuit()` is a thin wrapper returning the
  first, so `equiv`, `plotting` and `laplace` are unchanged. The ranking is
  `_rank_solutions`: it judges **design unknowns only** -- symbols not named
  `v_*` or `i_*`, since a node voltage or a branch current may perfectly well
  be negative -- putting all-real ahead of complex and all-non-negative ahead
  of negative, with ties keeping SymPy's order. So the root a person would
  have chosen leads, and the others remain available rather than discarded.
- **`symbulator.t` and `symbulator.s` are exported**, and `Result.at()`
  substitutes by *name*. The solver builds its time variable as
  `Symbol("t", positive=True)`; a user's own bare `Symbol("t")` is a different
  symbol, so `.subs()` silently did nothing and returned the expression
  unchanged. `res.at("v_2", t=0.001)` gives one value, `res.at(t=0.001)` a new
  Result with everything evaluated, `.solutions` included. Assumptions no
  longer have to be guessed at.

### Fixed
- **A floating sub-circuit solved silently.** `e1,1,0,5:r1,2,3,1` has nodes 2
  and 3 with no path to the reference node, and came back with `v_2 = v_3` and
  `r_e1 = oo` rather than an error. `_validate_topology` now runs a union-find
  over element terminals (an op-amp joins all three of its terminals, grounded
  two-port blocks tie both nodes to 0, `m` is skipped since it names inductors
  rather than nodes) and names the orphaned nodes.
- **Contradictory circuits gave a generic error.** Sources in parallel, a 0 Ohm
  resistor across a source, current sources in series -- all produced "Could
  not solve the system of equations… try symbolic values only", which is not
  what is wrong. `_diagnose_unsolvable` now names a voltage loop and lists its
  members, or names a node fed only by current sources. It runs only when
  `sp.solve` returns nothing, so the ordinary path is untouched.

### Security
- **Values and equations are checked before `sympify` sees them.** `sympify`
  is `eval` underneath, and a restricted namespace constrains only *names* --
  conditional expressions, lambdas, attribute access and subscripting all still
  ran. This matters for the web app, which feeds it strangers' input.
  `check_expression_syntax` parses with `ast` first and admits only numeric
  constants, plain names, arithmetic, unary sign, tuples, and calls of a bare
  function name with no keyword arguments; anything else raises
  `UnsafeExpressionError`. It is called inside `safe_sympify`, so values,
  `equations=` and `conditions=` are all covered.

### Documentation
- README no longer tells PyPI users to `pip install -r requirements.txt`, a
  file the distribution does not contain, and no longer links `llms.txt`
  relatively -- the link only resolved inside a checkout. Project URLs now
  include the source repository and the documentation site instead of pointing
  `Homepage` at PyPI itself. The package is described as Symbulator 9, matching
  symbulator.com.

## 0.4.5 — 21 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **An expert-mode equation written on a derived quantity was silently
  discarded** -- `r_e`, `p_r1`, `v_r2`, `z_e` and the like. Those are
  computed by `analysis._derived()` *after* `solve_circuit()` returns, as
  algebra on the finished solution, so the solver had never heard of the
  names. The convenience that turns a brand-new symbol in an extra
  equation into an unknown then registered each one as a free variable
  that happened to share the name: `Eq(r_e, 12000)` was satisfied by
  setting that phantom to 12000, which cost the system nothing and told
  the circuit nothing. The answer came back correct but one constraint
  short -- parametrized in a leftover node voltage instead of resolved to
  numbers -- with nothing raised, nothing logged, and a result object
  that looked entirely normal. `engine._derived_definition()` now
  recognises a symbol naming a derived quantity of an element actually
  present in the circuit and stamps in the equation defining it in terms
  of the system's own unknowns, so the constraint lands on the circuit.
  The `r_`/`z_` forms are written multiplied out rather than as a
  division, keeping the system polynomial and stopping a zero current
  from putting a division by zero into it. Matching is against real
  element names rather than a prefix pattern, so ordinary labels like
  `pout`, `vin` and `r_b` are untouched unless they genuinely collide
  with an element in that circuit, and a name listed in `unknowns` is
  still registered first and left alone -- an explicit list continues to
  win.
- **An equation on a current held in `circuit.known` was discarded the
  same way** -- a `j` source's current, and a capacitor's in AC, are
  recorded rather than solved for, so `i_j1 = 0.005` became another
  phantom. Extra equations are now substituted against `known` before
  being stamped, turning that into a real constraint on the source's
  symbolic value. An equation left with nothing in it afterwards is
  dropped as redundant; one left as a flat contradiction now says so
  plainly instead of surfacing later as "could not solve the system".

### Changed
- **The AC power quantities refuse an expert-mode equation instead of
  ignoring one.** `s_`, `p_` and `ap_` in the AC domain are defined
  through `v * conjugate(i)`, and conjugation is not something
  `sympy.solve` can carry through a system, so there is no definition to
  stamp. They now raise `CircuitError` naming the quantity and pointing
  at the `v_`/`i_` restatement that does work. No working call breaks:
  none of these ever produced a constrained answer.

## 0.4.4 — 21 Aug 2026

### Added
- **`parse_circuit()` and `expand_shorthand()` take a new `expand_si`
  / `si` flag (default `True`, unchanged behaviour)** that, when set to
  `False`, leaves SI-prefix shorthand (`4.7'M`) in each value field
  exactly as typed instead of expanding it to a literal number. This is
  for callers that only want to echo a circuit description back to the
  user -- e.g. after normalising `i`/`I` to `j`, or after resolving a
  bare ambiguous suffix -- where the notation the person actually typed
  is worth more to them than the number it stands for. Solving still
  goes through the normal expansion (`expand_si=True`) as its own,
  separate parse, so this has no effect on any circuit's actual answers.

### Fixed
- **An AC element whose complex power should come back purely real or
  purely imaginary could instead show a tiny leftover in the other
  part** -- e.g. a resistor's power reading `0.006098 + 4.445e-18j`
  instead of plain `0.006098`, or an inductor's reading
  `-7.589e-19 + 0.006098j` instead of plain `0.006098j`. That leftover
  is ordinary floating-point noise from multiplying already-computed
  complex floats, and every rounding/display mode showed its own
  version of it -- including "exact", which showed the ugliest,
  full-precision version. `dc()`/`ac()` now recognise when one part of
  a complex power or impedance is negligible next to the other (with
  plenty of margin above the actual noise floor) and zero it out, so
  both parts are held to the same standard instead of each showing
  whatever noise it happened to accumulate. Exact/rational answers
  (e.g. from a circuit with no floats in it at all) are untouched, since
  they can't carry this kind of noise in the first place.

## 0.4.3 — 21 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- **"Third-level" quantities (a capacitor's current, a dependent
  current source's value, and anything derived from them like complex
  power) could come back still containing a raw node-voltage or
  branch-current symbol** -- e.g. `i_c1 = 0.001j*v_3` even though `v_3`
  itself was correctly solved to a plain number. These quantities are
  stamped in terms of the symbols `Circuit.v()` hands out *before* the
  KCL system is solved, and were never substituted with the final
  solved values afterwards -- on the original calculator they were
  evaluated on the fly instead. `solve_circuit()` now substitutes the
  solved system into every such quantity as its one evaluation pass, so
  they always come back fully resolved, same as every other answer.

## 0.4.2 — 20 Aug 2026

### Changed
- **`i`, `I`, `j` and `J` are reserved for the imaginary unit in AC
  only** (and in the AC mode of `th()`/`er()`/`port()`). Outside AC --
  `dc()`, `fd()`, `tr()`, and DC-mode `th()`/`er()`/`port()` -- there is
  no such thing as a complex component value, so those four letters are
  now free to use as ordinary variable or element-value names there,
  same as any other name. `safe_sympify()` and `hijacked_names()` take a
  new `reserve_imaginary` keyword (default `True`, matching 0.4.0's
  always-reserved behaviour) for callers that want the same
  domain-aware rule.

## 0.4.1 — 19 Aug 2026

### Fixed
- The `[a,b,c]` parallel-resistor shorthand is expanded correctly again.

### Added
- `time_samples()` and `bode_samples()`, powering the web front end's
  "Plot vs. time" and "Bode plot" tools.

## 0.4.0 — 18 Aug 2026

### Changed (breaking)
- **`i`, `I`, `j` and `J` are reserved for the imaginary unit** and can
  no longer be variable names. Every spelling now agrees: `3j`, `3*j`,
  `3*i`, `3*I` and bare `j` all mean the same thing. Previously `3*j`
  silently produced a variable, which looked right and gave a wrong
  answer.
- **Values are parsed against a restricted namespace.** Names SymPy
  would otherwise reinterpret — `Q`, `S`, `N`, `beta`, `gamma`, `E` and
  the like — are now ordinary variables, which is what someone writing
  `Q` for quality factor intends. `pi` and the maths functions (`exp`,
  `sqrt`, `sin`, `Heaviside`, …) still mean what they say. Euler's
  number is now written `exp(1)` rather than `E`.
- **Element letters, element names and node names are case-insensitive**
  and fold to lowercase: `R1` and `r1` are one resistor, `A` and `a` one
  node. Writing both spellings is now correctly reported as a duplicate
  instead of silently creating two elements. Values keep their case,
  because `'M` and `'m` differ by a billion.
- **The exa prefix is gone.** `E` belongs to scientific notation
  (`8E3` = 8000), which is worth more in a circuit than exa-ohms.
- **`ex()` no longer accepts a transient mode**, matching the
  calculator, whose prompt reads "Analysis? 1:DC 2:AC 3:FD". The
  previous docstring wrongly claimed the TI offered a fourth option.
  Call `tr()` directly for transient analysis.

### Added
- Both micro characters are accepted: MICRO SIGN (U+00B5) and GREEK
  SMALL LETTER MU (U+03BC) look identical and which one a keyboard
  produces is arbitrary, so `4.7'µ` works either way.
- `safe_sympify()` and `hijacked_names()` for callers that want the same
  parsing rules or want to tell a user which names were reinterpreted.

## 0.3.0 — 17 Aug 2026

### Changed (breaking)
- **Bare unit suffixes are no longer guessed.** A value like `1k` is
  ambiguous — it could mean the SI unit (`1'k` = 1000) or one times a
  variable named `k` (`1*k`) — so the default policy `suffix="ask"` now
  raises `AmbiguousValueError` listing every such value instead of
  silently choosing. Pass `suffix="si"` or `suffix="var"` to decide for
  a whole circuit, or write the explicit form. Code written against
  0.1.0 that used bare suffixes needs one of those changes.

### Added
- `find_ambiguous_values(desc)` scans a description for ambiguous
  values without solving, for callers that want to ask a user.
- Expert mode: `equations`, `unknowns` and `conditions` arguments on
  `dc`/`ac`/`fd`/`tr`/`ex` (and the tools), porting the original's
  "Add equations / Add unknowns / Add conditions" prompts. Conditions
  are solve-time substitutions, the calculator's `|` operator.
- Branch voltages are now stored as `v_<element>`, matching the
  `v<name>` variables the calculator kept.
- Circuit descriptions may separate elements with newlines as well as
  `:`.

### Fixed
- A source carrying no current (for example one feeding only a
  capacitor in DC) raised `ZeroDivisionError` out of mpmath when
  computing the resistance/impedance it sees. It now reports infinity,
  and the genuinely undefined 0 V / 0 A case omits the quantity.

### Docs
- The `s` element is described as a short circuit.
